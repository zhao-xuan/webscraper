The main spatial inequalities in the EU and the wider Europe are outlined, as are some of the trends in regional inequality since the early 1960s and their relation to economic performance. Considerable emphasis is placed on evidence of the dysfunctionality of wide inequalities for economic development, and it is argued that a neo-liberal programme of market integration and an intensification of competition for investment creates a zero-sum gain in which the gains of the winners are often at the expense of the losers. An initial attempt is made to identify some of the winners and losers of the late 1970s and 1980s and to identify some of the factors that help explain why some regions were more successful than others.",,"Research Article"
"The Role of Producer Services in Industrial and Regional Development: The Nordic Case",Mick Dunford;Peter Sjøholt;Neil Ravenscroft;Stephen Young;Neil Hood;Alan Wilson;Inga Lena Grønlund;Tatyana Nefedova;Vladimir Baláz;Stephen Fothergill;Tim Unwin;Eike Schamp;Rachel Macdonald;Markus Hesse;,1994,36,8,"The principal focus of this article is producer-related services, their growing need in enterprises and the ways in which this need is being satisfied through different transactional forms (by being internalized or externalized). This leads to a discussion of whether the substantial services growth during the early and mid-1980s was genuine or merely reflected changes of transactional forms. Growth and its regional reper cussions are analysed by uncovering how the changes were a consequence of cyclical changes, new general conditions or frames of reference (deregulation), re structuring of enterprises and the role of financial operations and transactions. Changing trends and pat terns at the start of the 1990s are then examined in the light not only of recession but also of new possible structural readjustments in production systems, and the changing role of financial institutions. Regional impacts are examined by analyses of recent data, mainly from Norway but also from other Nordic countries.",,"Research Article"
"Leisure Policy in the New Europe: The Uk Department of National Heritage as a Model of Development and Integration",Mick Dunford;Peter Sjøholt;Neil Ravenscroft;Stephen Young;Neil Hood;Alan Wilson;Inga Lena Grønlund;Tatyana Nefedova;Vladimir Baláz;Stephen Fothergill;Tim Unwin;Eike Schamp;Rachel Macdonald;Markus Hesse;,1994,48,2,"Leisure is in the vanguard of a social and cultural revolution which is replacing the former east/west political bipolarity with a globalized economic system in which the new Europe has a central role. Within this revolution, leisure, including recreation, culture and tourism, is constructed as the epitome of success ful capitalist development, the very legitimation of the global transmogrification from a production to a con sumption orientation. While acting as a direct en couragement to the political transformation in many eastern European states, it is uncertain how the issue of leisure policy is being handled, given its centrality to the new economic order. This article therefore examines the experience of western Europe, con sidering in particular the degree to which the newly created Department of National Heritage in the UK provides a potential model for leisure development and policy integration in the new Europe. Despite an official rhetoric of support and promotion of leisure activities, reflecting the growing economic significance of tourism and the positive relationship between leisure provision and regional economic development, the article establishes that in the place of the tra ditional role of the state in promoting leisure interests, the introduction of the department has sig nified a shift to the use of leisure to promote the government's interests, particularly in regenerating citizen rights claims towards the market. While an institution such as the Department of National Heri tage may have relevance to emerging states as an element in the maintenance of political hegemony, therefore, it is questionable how far it can be viewed as a promoter or protector of leisure as a signifier of a newly won political, economic and cultural freedom throughout Europe.",,"Research Article"
"Targeting Policy as a Competitive Strategy for European Inward Investment Agencies",Mick Dunford;Peter Sjøholt;Neil Ravenscroft;Stephen Young;Neil Hood;Alan Wilson;Inga Lena Grønlund;Tatyana Nefedova;Vladimir Baláz;Stephen Fothergill;Tim Unwin;Eike Schamp;Rachel Macdonald;Markus Hesse;,1994,38,42,"This article provides a framework to assist the target ing activities of European inward investment agencies (IIAs), recognizing that historically inward investment has not fulfilled the desired role of facilitating self- sustaining and innovative economic development in many European regions. While many such agencies do target their promotional programmes, the variables utilized in defining target markets have been in sufficiently directed to the real issues in economic development. Using techniques applied in industrial products' marketing, a new approach is presented, which relates the desired outputs from inward invest ment (based on a segment's level of economic impact indicators and their weighted importance) to the competitive advantages of countries and regions (based on the country's strengths and weaknesses relative to each segment's requirements). In this model, the economic impact indicators go well beyond simply employment creation to consider other employment indicators as well as trade and balance of payments and technology transfer indi cators which are critical to economic development. A matrix of appropriateness is developed which identi fies the segments that should be targeted by the par ticufar IIA based on the attractiveness of the segment and country competitive advantages. Operational considerations are reviewed and policy implications discussed.",,"Research Article"

Through a description of their corporate development since the early 1970s it shows that these groups, which still remain mainly European and non-globalized, have developed numerous specialized alliances, but have also used mergers and acquisitions as a way of enlarging their corporate size and their geographic scope. The major conclusion is to predict more international mergers between European groups in the future. As the international crisis in the sector continues, and as international competition increases within their formerly protected markets, these groups will have to join forces through close co-operation and merger. The second part of the article develops the case of Renault's international strategy. It analyses how this group improved the competitiveness of all its European operations, but failed in the USA and still remains today relatively under-internationalized. The agreement signed in 1990 with Volvo is then described as a highly complex strategic alliance which had to move towards a merger, finally decided at the end of 1993. This merger process failed mainly because nationalist barriers exist to international co-operation in the automobile industry. The recent take-over of Rover by BMW, however, shows that merger remains an appropriate strategic answer.",,"Research Article"
"The Emigration and Employment of Irish Graduates: The Export of High-Quality Labour From the Periphery of Europe",Jim Lewis;Julien Savary;Russell King;Ian Shuttleworth;Pertti Koistinen;Brian Ilbery;David Clark;Nigel Berkeley;Ian Goldman;Manuel Villaverde Cabral;Mark Blacksell;Peter Gripaios;Manuel Valenzuela;Judith Moreno;Zoltan Raffay;Diane Perrons;Jeff Blackford;Michael Keating;Linda McDowell;Richard Black;,1995,48,22,"During the late 1980s, emigration of university graduates from the Republic of Ireland rose to unprecedented levels. More than one-quarter of the graduates were living abroad nine months after graduation, according to statistics issued by the Higher Education Authority. After reviewing the changing socio-economic background to Irish emigration since the early 1950s, the second, and major, part of the article will present the findings of a large-scale empirical investigation of the employment and migration histories of a sample of 383 graduates who left Irish universities in the mid-1980s. This survey was carried out in 1990 and so recorded approximately five years of occupational and spatial mobility for each respondent. Although the survey results do back up popular impressions of an Irish brain drain, in many respects Irish high-skilled migration is merely a subset of total Irish migration since the graduates were found to rely on traditional family and ethnic networks in choosing their destination and often their employment. The destination countries of Irish graduate emigrants closely reflected the destinations of Irish emigrants as a whole, except that graduates showed a higher propensity to migrate to continental European countries. Moreover, a lot of to-and-fro movement was discovered, indicating that Irish graduates are highly mobile and responsive to opportunities at home and abroad. Finally the theoretical and policy implications of the research are evaluated. Conceptually the Irish brain drain can be contextualized within centre-periphery theory and the notion of Ireland having a truncated labour market: in other words, as a small-scale, geographically peripheral, unindustrialized and ex-colonial economy, Ireland cannot provide sufficient challenging jobs for its graduate population, which is itself increasing. Policy-wise, educating young people for export may be hard to justify, particularly when this investment in human capital is exported to richer countries like the United States, Britain and Germany.",,"Research Article"

On the contrary, the nation-state is searching for a new structure and is playing a crucial role in the transformation and modernization process. The examples of countries from central and eastern Europe demonstrate the importance of nation-state formation as a mediating factor during the current spate of economic and sacial changes. It provides the focal point for interest groups in society and more generally for external relations in the evolving global system of world capitalism. A problem in social science today is that there is too little critical research into how the nation-state and the capitalist market economy are interlinked, and how the former shapes the formation of welfare systems, labour institutions and labour market policies. Using the case study examples of Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and to some extent the former GDR, the concept of a national solution to the transform. ation process will be examined in each country with respect to the search for an employment policy.",,"Research Article"

However, little is known about patterns of and resistances towards the adoption of telematics in rural areas and there exists a view that the main beneficiaries will be larger businesses in core areas of economic activity. After a brief exploration of the relationships between telematics and rural development, this article reports the early findings of a research project on the use of, and attitudes towards, telematics among SMEs in seven rural regions of the European Union. Results indicate that the predominantly very small, independent and privately owned businesses make very limited use of telematics services, mainly because of a lack of awareness and inadequate training. The main business problems faced by these businesses — cashflow, marketing, lack of qualified staff, and information technology support- present opportunities for telematics in rural areas. Yet successful adoption of telematics applications will occur only if they are sympathetic to the needs of small rural businesses. The article concludes by suggesting some ways in which the benefits of telematics can favour peripheral rural areas as well as urban core areas.",,"Research Article"

This paper draws on this literature to consider the background and debates within the United Kingdom, one of the most centralized states in the European Union, on the setting up of Scotland Europa, a Scot tish lobbying office in Brussels in May 1992. The resurgence of political nationalism in Scotland in the late 1980s coincided with the 'relaunch' of Europe, with the Single European Act and the single European Market providing significant backdrops. Government fears that such an office might be used by its oppo nents to articulate alternative views were voiced in leaked memoranda and these provide important insights into its thinking. In essence, the issue of 'Who speaks for Scotland?' lay at the heart of debates on the nature and functions of the Brussels office. Europe was offering a new battleground in an old war. In particular, difficulties existed between the Scottish Office, representing central government, and the Scottish local authorities. These were ultimately resolved largely due to the skills of the first chief executive of the lobbying office. To date, a limited role has been cut out for Scotland Europa. Conse quently, the fears that paradiplomacy might become protodiplomacy- whereby the international activities of regions no longer parallel those of their central governments but act against them and threaten the integrity of the state - have proved unfounded.",,"Research Article"

The EU internal market programme provides an opportunity to reduce service market fragmentation and make European services as a whole more competitive in world markets. Successful implementation of the pro gramme may be accompanied by some relocation of producer services within the Union. A recent study suggests that this would not raise undue concern among the member states, In this paper it is suggested that there is a potential conflict between evidence for a wider dispersal of producer services within the British space economy (and the benefits that it rep resents for the process of regional economic restruc turing) and any centralization tendencies in relation to a European-wide market. This will reassert the hegemony of London and the South East which will ensure that Britain capitalizes upon the EU internal market programme but at the expense of a continuing improvement in the range and quality of producer services in the provincial cities and regions.",,"Research Article"

Regional policy funding now commands around 30 per cent of all European Union expendi ture. In the recent (1994-99) round of structural fund allocations there were more 'winners' than 'losers'. Over 60 per cent of the European territory is now covered by the funds. A number of local authori ties, justifiably pleased with the award of funds to their territories, are full of 'campaign lessons' of 'successful lobbying in Brussels'. Yet structural fund application procedures dictate that individual regions cannot enter into negotiations with the EU to obtain funds; rather, they can only seek to influence member states, the 'gatekeepers' for applications made to the EU for structural funding. The real 'winners' of struc tural fund awards are the member states themselves. This is because the spending of structural funds is diffcult to audit with any certainty, enabling member states to use European money as substitute territorial funding, rather than meeting EU rules designed to ensure that European funds are additional to national spending on the regions. Detailed insights are pro vided into the processes of applying for, spending, and auditing EU structural funds, demonstrating how it is possible for member states to draw benefit for central government spending programmes from funds intended for territorial initiatives. Rather than a 'Eur ope of the Regions' it would appear that EU spending can be recycled back to national governments, reinforcing centralization rather than creating decen tralization. The absence of strong regional 'policy net works' of public and private players in centralized unitary member states to monitor additionality exacerbates the problem. Case study material from Grampian, Scotland, is presented to illustrate these processes.",,"Research Article"

Using the case of the Contrat de Ville for Lille, it then assesses how far these structures have constrained the development of the Contrat.",,"Research Article"
"Crisis in German Decentralized Production: Unexpected Rigidity and the Challenge of an Alternative Form of Flexible Organization in Baden Württemberg",Elizabeth Strom;Howard Green;Philip Booth;Gary Herrigel;Frank Peck;Ian Stone;Marisol Esteban;Jesús del Río Luelmo;Tom Gallagher;Bodo Freund;Jorge Gaspar;David Sadler;Sally Hayward;Judit Timár;Heinz Heineberg;Jan van Weesep;Dick Lawless;Marta Bruno;James Barlow;,1996,61,29,"This paper discusses the current crisis in the German industrial district of Baden Württemberg. Considered to be a flagship example of flexibility and international competitiveness for European manufacturing during the 1980s, producers in the district - both large and small - have fallen upon hard times in the 1990s. This paper suggests that the explanation for the crisis can not be traced either to high wages or low levels of productivity in the region. Rather, the problem con fronting the producers in Baden Württemberg- and by extension in German industry as a whole - is that they are being challenged by an alternative system of flexible manufacturing that is superior to their own. Rigidity in the system of production in Germany can be traced to institutional arrangements that were previously thought to be a source of strength: broad yet nonetheless specific skill categories and distinct, functional divisions within management. Successful adjustment in Germany today will have to involve profound self-reflection on and debate about the reform of some of the most taken-for-granted dimen sions of German industrial order.",,"Research Article"

Such policies are constructed on the basis that the creation of an appropriate infrastructure can induce cumulative development of technologically-related activities. In theory it is expected that the growth process will be characterized by a high degree of innovation, the application of locally-generated knowledge, flexible forms of organization and inter dependence between enterprises. Previous research has shown that there is considerable variability in the forms of development which occur on technology parks, and a debate has developed concerning the potential for the decentralization of high technology industry to peripheral locations. While many tech nology parks may not attain the ideal in terms of technological synergies, they can nonetheless produce significant regional development outcomes. This is demonstrated through a case study of the Andalucia Technology Park situated on the outskirts of the City of Milaga in the south of Spain. In this case, the high technology label has plainly acted as a magnet for public sector funding, which has been used to create the kind of modern customized infra structure demanded by inward investors. The initial 'cost-per-job' has undoubtedly been high, but the availability of financial support from the public sector suggests that expansions of existing projects and further inward investment are likely to occur. This interpretation of technology parks has important implications for our understanding of regional policy in the 1990s. Many technology parks, in reality, are used to produce what can be regarded as less ambitious but significant regional policy outcomes (i.e. job-creation through relocation and inward investment) and are perhaps more appropriately judged in those terms.",,"Research Article"

Mellor;Adam Swain;Eleanore Kofman;,1996,71,12,"This paper seeks to comprehend the nature of the relationship between economic restructuring and various processes of demographic change in Europe. The analysis reveals a broad set of complex inter relations between the economic and population systems. Population cannot be taken as a single de pendent variable acting in response to economic change. Demographic processes such as ageing and fertility decline can also act as independent variables providing feedback and input into socio-economic restructuring, and they can also be regarded as a kind of background system, reacting rather inertly compared to the short-term cycles and transform ations in the economy. Therefore demographic changes are often underestimated in their medium and long-term feedback effects. The labour market is taken as the main field of interplay between the sys tems of economy and population and thus this paper takes a close look at some important changes within the European labour market and submarkets. Changing employment conditions - the growth of the secondary labour market, the flexibilization of labour demand and increasingly also of supply, grow ing female labour force participation rates, generally high ethnic minority unemployment - reflect differ ent aspects of the transition from the Fordist to the postFordist regime as well as changing demographic and life-style influences. Together they have deeply transformed the European landscape of employment and unemployment The specific role of international migration is also analysed and it is seen to have fun damentally altered between the Fordist and postFordist eras. Less clear to interpret are changing internal migration patterns: has counterur banization stopped in response to restructuring and integration and is a new postFordist population map unfolding? The paper concludes by evaluating the nature of the relationship between economic restructuring and population trends and identifying pointers for future research.",,"Research Article"

It compares Swiss schemes with agri-environmental schemes in the EU (specifically the ESA and MEKA schemes) and hypothesizes what effects possible Swiss EU membership might have for the structure of its agri-environmental schemes and its landholders. Davos has been selected as a case-study to illustrate problems and opportunities of agri-environmental schemes in upland areas, and to provide a baseline for comparison in a European context. Swiss agri-environmental policies show great similarities with those of the EU and, under current conditions, Swiss EU membership would not have a great impact. The on-going debate about Euro-compatibility in Switzerland has led to a fruitful discussion and questioning of internal decision-making processes, but the EU can also learn from the Swiss experience, in particular with respect to Swiss targeting policies. Swiss integration into the EU would reinforce the already existing trend towards renunciation of an essentially productivist farming ethos in an economic environment still largely free from the problems of agricultural overproduction. It would also further encourage farmers to adopt farming practices that are more in line with EU post-productivist strategies of reduced agrarian production, while at the same time still maintaining the strong Swiss emphasis on environmental protection.",,"Research Article"

The analysis considers a striking rhetorical shift in Italian discourses; if, initially, the Albanians were depicted in this crisis as 'Adriatic brothers' and 'noble savages' who vafidated the ideal of western democracy against Communism, over the course of the crisis they became increasingly represented as merely savage and 'non-European'. This shift was paralleled in the problem of defining the Albanians as 'political refugees' or 'economic migrants', the latter designation aligning them with immigrants from developing countries whose presence has increasingly been a site of tension in Italy, as in many other western European countries. Additionally, the article considers the self reflection stimulated in Italy in the wake of the Albanian Crisis, which in many respects problematized ltaly's own rightful position alongside other European nations.

National governments and history strongly influence the present political power of the regions of Europe and thus the environment of firms. In West Germany the relative autonomy of Länder gave them opportunities to implement their own technology policy at the end of the 1970s. Focusing on regional technology policies in one old Land, Baden-Württemberg, and one new Land, Thuringia, in Germany in the mid-1990s, three main questions are asked in this article. First, what are the objectives, actors, instruments and strategies of regional technology policies in Baden-Württemberg and Thuringia and how much political autonomy do these Länder have to devise their own policies? Secondly, what are the effects of regional technology policies in Baden-Württemberg and Thuringia on regional economic development? Thirdly, to what extent do regional technology policies in Baden-Württemberg and Thuringia tackle specific regional economic problems ? The main conclusion is that both in Baden-Württemberg, a Land with a long tradition in technology policy and large economic problems, and in Thuringia, a new Land with an economy which suffered heavily from restructuring, regional technology policies have limited impacts on regional economies in transition.",,"Research Article"

Central functions (marketing, planning, R & D, luxury and upper range car assembly, etc.) located in the 'Banane Bleue', are attracted by the centre of gravity in southern Germany, whereas peripheral functions (assembly of small cars, production of generic components) are decentralized to southern European countries, and now eastern countries. Secondly, the paper identifies factors governing its evolution: changes in production organization (technological innovation, lean production) and their impacts on the location of activities (through a desegregated approach to location constraints on different activities: assembly, manufacturing, generic and specific components, etc.), as well as the new competitive context on the European market (arrival of new competitors, reduction of overcapacity, new niches, etc.). Thirdly, a sketch of the spatial configuration of the European automobile industry in 2005 is proposed on the basis of two opposite modalities of complementary spatial dynamics: on one side, concentration versus decentralization of assembly plants; on the other side, polarization or dispersion of upstream activities. Their intersection leads to four possible scenario-configurations: agglomerated unipolar, dispersed unipolar, multipolar and continental integration. Finally, conditions which would encourage or, alternatively, impede each scenario are discussed.",,"Research Article"

At the heart of the paper is a review of a number of such studies. Some of them set out to identify the 'hottest' regions for investors, often presenting their results in various forms of rankings or league tables. Others try to identify systemic transformation in the overall patterns of urban and regional change in Europe. Most studies, however, regardless of whether they see regional development as primarily driven by endogenous or exogenous processes, focus on the regions' set of factor endowments : the more richly endowed a region is, the greater is its chance to prosper in a situation where regions are seen to be engaged in a European - or even global - competition over development opportunities. In the latter part of the paper, we challenge this view. With reference to current research on industrial dynamics, we argue that sustainable regional strength is built on a continuously upgraded knowledge base, rather than on general factor endowments. Furthermore, we question the validity of the metaphor according to which regions compete with each other to develop.",,"Research Article"

Understanding and grasping such opportunities is crucial for improving Europe's competitive position in the global car market. This article explores this issue by embarking on a historical analysis of the European automotive production system applying the filiere concept. In doing so, the analysis focuses on internal relationships within the production chain as well as on the sociopolitical embedding of production. The main argument put forward is that enhanced innovative capabilities and competitive performance require more than the implementation of lean strategies within the existing business structure. Despite the intensive restructuring undertaken over the last decade, it seems that the industry is not fully exploiting the opportunities offered by market integration in Europe. This stagnation is attributed primarily to the vested interests of the major carmakers in retaining the present organizational structure and their political influence. The article develops a 'merging filiere' perspective which involves, besides genuine internationalization at various stages of the production chain, a more substantial shift in the responsibilities for design and production from carmakers to main suppliers and a certain detachment of producers from their home environment. The last section of the article focuses on the role of European policy. It is argued that the European Commission should set more distance between itself and the large carmakers and adopt a more favourable attitude towards the independent component industries.",,"Research Article"

Arguing within a locational competition framework, we differentiate between the macro and the micro-level. On the macro-level, encompassing for example infrastructure and education, the European periphery is clearly disadvantaged vis-a-vis the core member states. On the micro-level, focusing on direct support to the productive sector, European state-aid regulations establish a hierarchy. According to Article 92 of the EC Treaty, least-favoured regions and regions in industrial decline are allowed to use region-specific state aid in order to attract mobile factors of production. All other regions are only allowed to use horizontal state aid. In the empirical analysis we show, however, that this privilege is not reflected in higher state-aid expenditure levels of the periphery vis-a-vis the core. This is mainly due to the limited budgetary possibilities of the peripheral member states. The present spatial pattern of expenditures reduces the prospects for cohesion and the efficiency of regional policy, and it leads to a waste of resources. The aggregate amount of state aid in Europe, as well as the market distortions induced by this state aid, is unnecessarily inflated. We therefore argue in favour of a tightening of state-aid regulations for the core countries and suggest a further concentration of EU resources in the periphery.",,"Research Article"

Both areas have gone through a process of severe de-in-dustrialization and deep social change, accompanied by significant political developments. The article examines the effects these changes have had upon the two localities, both from the point of view of social identities and of the role and orientations of local political actors. Research findings in both towns indicate that there is a congruence between underlying social identities and the specific solutions attempted by the main political actors to deal with de-industrialization. In Sesto, the Communist Party and the left-dominated council have reacted to a weakening of the communist subculture by shedding their traditional proletarian image. They are keen to promote the development of small-scale industry, relying on the resilience and vitality of the family and social networks. In Venissieux the social situation is closer to 'anomie', while the left subculture is closing ranks and adopting a defensive stance. The local council relies on central government for large-scale schemes of urban regeneration. Nation-specific patterns of political behaviour and socioeconomic development prevail over crossnational similarities. A common phase as urban conurbations dominated by a small number of large corporations and as centres of trade-union militancy and communist culture has given way to contrasting scenarios.",,"Research Article"

It argues that SME development is not resulting in capitalist development which mirrors that of the industrial district model. The argument is developed through considering the concrete experience of SME development and institutional innovation in two regions in central Slovakia, partly drawing upon the results of a survey of SMEs in the manufacturing sector. I argue that there has only been a limited development of SMEs and that they retain a marginal role in regional economic restructuring even though significant resources have been devoted to the construction of local industrial districts. I argue that we are witnessing the emergence of localized competition (rather than cooperation) between small firms, between small and large locally dominant companies, and between small productive capital and finance capital. This experience suggests that we need to reconsider the suitability of 'western' development discourses in the context of transformation in Central and Eastern Europe.",,"Research Article"

Pratt;Keith Salmon;Mike Rawlinson;Michael Taylor;,1997,65,36,"In the production of a dominant ideology for local economic policy, concepts of partnership currently play a key role. However, conceptualizations of partnership which inform the policy process are often weakened by a failure to recognize the unequal power relations between social partners, as well as by implicit assumptions of the existence of a range of partners available to be drawn into the local development process. This article explores current dominant notions of partnership and forms of economic governance and the role of international organizations in promoting particular ideologies of partnership. Through analysis of recent experiences in Portugal, this article examines how in practice the development of partnerships has been heavily constrained by the underdeveloped nature of local social partners, plus the unequal power relations between local and central state organizations and other locally based institutions. It is argued that policies promoting partnership must recognize these inequalities between partners and show awareness of the need to build up local institutional capacities for promoting economic development. Such policies are required in order to construct a politics of partnership embedded in democratic and participative processes of local development and to avoid the domination of the local development process by restricted local and national interests.",,"Research Article"

In the second part, the changing relationships between these key network utilities and the users of utility services are analysed and the broad logic of 'splintering networks' is identified. Three elements of this restructuring are explored: the 'rebalancing' of tariffs and cost-reflective pricing; the use of new metering technologies for 'cherry picking' affluent consumers while 'socially dumping' more marginal ones; and the development of new IT strategies for supporting the social construction of segmented markets. The concluding part of the article identifies the implications of the reorientation of utilities for social and spatial polarization within cities, and draws out implications for urban policy and research.",,"Research Article"

However, individual territories react differently to these overall processes, according to their inherited structures (economic, sociodemographic, political and spatial), and the innovative capacities of their businesses, public bodies and social authorities. These factors contribute to a redistribution of the spatial division of labour. As a result, reference to national, regional and local labour markets has become commonplace in recent research, giving rise to controversies concerning, for example, their demarcation, thematic contents, the powers and factors which shape them, and dominant processes and trends. This article provides a framework for interpreting the features and the evolution of labour markets and then applies this to analysing tendencies in Spain's spatial division of labour.",,"Research Article"

As a result, it is not infrequently the case that this more or less sole focus on employment, although valuable in itself, produces an incomplete and sometimes some what distorted view of spatial economic change. The case of regional manufacturing restructuring in Greece during the 1970s and 1980s provides an example of the problems that over-concentration on employment can involve. By jointly examining the evolution of employment together with output, and the consequent labour productivity in the regions of Greece, the existence of two distinct geographies of uneven industrial expansion becomes apparent. The prefectures gaining most in terms of employment are not necessarily those gaining most in output. Although locally focused case-studies are probably what is required for a full understanding of the different facets of regional accumulation processes, the parallel examination of these three parameters provides a general idea of the possible different spatial outcomes of manufacturing expansion. It is this latter focus that is the purpose of this article.",,"Research Article"

Key events are charted by which the integration of environmental concerns came to hinge on a single contested issue-the adoption of Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA). The success of SEA in achieving environmental-policy integration is evaluated. An important aspect of this approach is to explore how the hegemonic discourses in the EU shape the policy process, and condition the success or failure of environmental integration. The article reflects on current debates about ecological modernization in the EU, arguing that the institutional learning model is inappropriate, and suggesting that understanding ecological modernization as cultural politics may bring a clearer understanding of the constructed nature of environmental-policy integration.",,"Research Article"

However, while reference is made to the gendered welfare regimes, gender arrangements and differentiated patriarchy explanations of gender inequality, caution is urged in terms of drawing inferences from changing gender roles in employment to wider changes in gender relations.",,"Research Article"

While there has been a remarkable quantitative expansion in female labourmarket participation in Switzerland and elsewhere, the proportion of women in positions with high-level decision-making power remains small. This article analyses the regional variations in gender inequality in Swiss employment for two different spatial dimensions: (a) 106 labour-market regions; and (b) four types of regions according to their position in the centre-periphery hierarchy. The results show that the proportion of women in positions of authority is considerably higher in the French and Italian-speaking regions than in similar German-speaking regions. Do these variations result from different cultural norms and values in different parts of Switzerland concerning gender relations? Are the French and Italian-speaking parts characterized by a more egalitarian gender culture? Or are there different concepts of the role of the welfare state inside Switzerland? Do the French and Italian-speaking cantons for instance offer better public provision to facilitate women's paid work? Or do these variations between the linguistic regions mainly conceal economic structures, for example different sectoral or branch structures in employment? This article discusses and assesses the usefulness of these three different theoretical approaches for providing an explanation of regional variations in gender inequalities in Swiss employment.",,"Research Article"

Drury;Brian W. Ilbery;Joe Painter;Angus Cameron;Caedmon Staddon;Mo O'Toole;Ray Hudson;,1998,22,16,"An increasing internationalization of economic activities in recent decades has led to relocation and restructuring of work processes in many parts of the world and in different sectors of the economy in labour-intensive industries. The search for greater flexibility in the labour market has enhanced the importance of 'atypical' work often falling within the so-called 'informal economy', in which female labour is prominent but can scarcely be traced in statistical records. A clear example of this restructuring in Southern Europe is industrial homeworking, which is carried out mainly by women within the context of the underground economy. In this article we try to shed light on the nature and function of women's industrial homeworking in different rural areas of Spain Catalonia, Valencia, Andalusia and Galicia - where economic restructuring has been particularly strong. While the type of work and the way home working is combined with other activities to boost household incomes varies between the regions, many of the women interviewees report similar experiences of homeworking, both positive and negative. In each case-study, however, it is clear that the choice to engage in homeworking is highly constrained. It is shaped by the restrictions deriving from gender roles and relations within the family and by the regional context.",,"Research Article"

The analysis indicates that although Greece has become one of the most progressive countries with respect to women's legal status, this is not necessarily reflected in behavioural changes at the interpersonal level. The influx of Greek women in the labour market is a necessary prerequisite, but not a sufficient condition, for the development of a new gender contract. Given the persistence of traditional economic structures within which the family retains a significant role, women's involvement in paid employment does not in itself signify a transformation of gender relations. For a large proportion of Greek women, therefore, work may be viewed as the result of a family strategy for collective income procurement and not necessarily as an indicator of more liberal gender-role ideologies. The article concludes that it is vitally important to establish the meaning that work carries for women themselves, as well as others in their social environment, by supplementing statistical information with qualitative in-depth analyses.",,"Research Article"

Three spatial scales are recognized: macro, meso and micro. Prior to the soft revolution of 1989, the Soviet model of heavy industrialization and international trading conditions were important issues, while at the national scale the government structured the industry and gave miners a special place in Polish society. Coal pro-duction could also be related to political vicissitudes. At the local scale the spatial characteristics of the industry strongly correlated with geology, bottom-up forces being weak The international collapse of communism fundamentally changed the fortunes of the industry, but despite the free market, the government continues to exercise considerable influence. Bottom-up forces are now more important, the col- lieries having a degree of autonomy, while the devolution of considerable political power to the counties has led to the enforcement of environmen- tal protection regulations.",,"Research Article"

First, the privileging of business interests by both European and domestic policy agendas has offered the private sector a far greater role in local regeneration partnerships. While there are doubts about the ability or willingness of businesses to make a meaningful contribution at the local level, the neoliberal agenda which has dominated policy making at the European level has had an important influence over the overall size and shape of the EU's structural funds. Second, local regeneration strategies have become increasingly dependent on EU programmes. This has provided the European Commission with greater influence over regeneration strategies in particular enabling it to encourage regional alliances between authorities. However, the overall pattern of local authorities' activity suggests that this has not led to the radical realignment of central-local relations envisaged by theories of multi-level governance. The strong 'gatekeeper' role of central government has meant that EU programmes have usually taken on a distinctly British flavour and that both the vertical and horizontal partnerships which have emerged in the UK have reflected a particular interpretation by central government of the principles embodied in the structural fund regulations. Very few British local authorities expect, or even aspire, to influence EU policy agendas. Current patterns of local economic governance in Britain are therefore best seen as the product of an increasingly fragmented European polity in which the power of local authorities has declined, the European Commission's influence has grown but central government has been able to retain a dominant position.",,"Research Article"

This article deals with the problems of regional integration in the German- Polish border region, following an approach that emphasizes the regions' economic organization, in stitutional fabric and sociocultural environment. New economic links between Western European and East-Central European firms do not necessarily lead to a revaluation of the border region or to the formation of transborder integrated economic regions. Instead, there is a tendency towards the de velopment of new economic links which overlook the border region. Up to now, cooperation between regional firms is weak within the border region. The region's sociocultural environment in terms of a 'low trust environment' and a specifically shaped social distance between the neighbouring regions are a fur ther hindrance to regional integration. These findings are being related to strategic options of re gional development policy in the border region.",,"Research Article"

Glasmeier;Sytze A. Rienstra;Piet Rietveld;,1999,48,336,"The article focuses on the relationship between technological and organizational innovation, and territories. This relationship is connected to interactions between learning processes, institutions and spatial patterns of innovative activities. Starting from a conception of the economy as a learning and evolutionary process instead of a static allocative mechanism, we analyse the role of several types of proximity in innovative processes. If one considers innovation as a problem-solving oriented process, it may be analysed as grounded on non-market inter-actions, and knowledge-based. The article shows how geographical, organizational and institutional proximities relate to the operation of localized innovation systems. The institutional framework is of particular importance in this context owing to the fact that such innovation systems are grounded on collective action at a territorial level and rely upon shared patterns of behavioural and cognitive rules. The analysis of institutional proximity raises the problems of the embeddedness of interrelations between actors in a territorial framework, and the transferability of tacit knowledge. This framework is extended to the analysis of spatial patterns in the emergence and diffusion of industrial models. In our conception, the emergence of an industrial model has territorial foundations, but it is also dependent upon an institutional learning process. However, once stabilized and diffused, its relation to geography and territories evolves and transforms. We illustrate this analysis by referring to the emergence and diffusion of industrial models in the automobile industry. Finally, the framework is used to analyse the spatial effects of organizational changes in product development. These changes are both institutional and technological.",,"Research Article"

This focus on knowledge is often presented as a dramatic breakthrough, promising radical theoretical reappraisal and opening up exciting new possibilities for the conception, implementation and practise of policy. Recognizing the importance of innovation and knowledge creation to economic success is hardly novel, however. The paper first summarizes the claims made by the proponents of ‘learning’, and some links are drawn between the pre-eminent emphasis that they place upon knowledge and learning and other literatures that analyse ongoing changes in the organization of production and work in contemporary capitalism and which have different emphases. The aim is to situate and contextualize claims about the significance of ‘learning’. These claims are then placed within the context of continuities and changes within capitalism, and the ways in which these have been understood, as a further step in this process of contextualization and situation. Finally, some conclusions are briefly drawn around the limits to learning, and questions of learning by whom, and for what purpose, in the context of the politics and policies of social, economic and territorial development.",,"Research Article"

The provision of services by non-statutory providers to older and disabled people in their own homes was one of the 19 employment fields identified (European Commission, 1998a). In the UK, considerable impetus has been given to the development of independent-sector domiciliary services by recent policies which combine care in the community with the introduction of competition to publicly funded social care. The responsibility for enabling social-care markets has been given to local authorities not in the capacity as main service provider, as historically was the case, but as the purchaser of services on behalf of individual users. This article explores the labour-market outcomes of local-authority contracting arrangements with independent-sector providers. It outlines providers’ arguments that current purchasing practices exacerbate the difficulties of recruiting, developing and retaining workers which arise from the highly fragmented nature of home-care itself. Importantly, existing outcomes appear counterproductive to the aim of achieving social and economic inclusion through the promotion of high-quality jobs in the independent sector. The article concludes that, in order to achieve the sector’s potential to recruit from the long-term unemployed, local authorities must approach their enabling role from the emerging EU policy perspective of Community Economic Development (CED) (European Commission, 1996a). Specifically, by employing ‘the community’ as the platform for service delivery, the problems of matching labour demand and supply in the sector could more effectively be addressed. Although immediately relevant in the UK context, these arguments have important implications for the development of home care as an employment field across the EU in general.",,"Research Article"

Recent studies have emphasized the importance of cooperation among interests as a key feature of endogenous growth. Organizations and interests which cooperate for purposes of economic intervention are seen to be particularly effective in managing growth. Italian chambers appear on the surface to have a strong potential for ‘cooperative endogenous development’. Unique among local organizations, the chambers provide an on-going structure for interaction and exchange among local economic interests. These are powerful organizations which have extensive resources and competences. Yet despite this considerable potential, we will see that the chambers do not tend to assume a prominent role in supporting economic growth. They are often confined to narrow regulatory functions and remain excluded from processes of economic innovation. The article examines the economic performance of the Italian chambers of commerce, drawing on empirical work carried out on three different chambers. It will consider why these seemingly powerful organizations do not in practice act as agencies of cooperative endogenous development.",,"Research Article"

Four relevant historical periods can be distinguished. The more general conclusion is that heterogeneous regional development is only a necessary (but not a sufficient) condition for a local state project to diverge from the national one. It seems that popular forces can only establish a counter-project at the local level if the national dominant bloc fails to gain mass acceptance for its ideological dispensation and an emerging counter-bloc is able to capitalize on this weakness by formulating its own social project.",,"Research Article"

Cities - or their elites - have increasingly sought to redefine and reimagine themselves through place marketing in ways which allow them to compete in the global marketplace. The ‘exceptional’ case of Berlin is explored in the context of regional and global restructuring. Berlin has been at the centre of dramatic changes over the last decade and has been forced to reimagine itself in quite a different set of global understandings. A series of different - competing and sometimes complementary - imaginary Berlins are being constructed in the process of reinsertion into ‘normal’ capitalist urbanization. The relationships between property-led visions with Berlin at the heart of a wider Europe, visions of Berlin as a revived capital of a united Germany and the redefinition of Berlin as an ordinary place are considered. Each of these visions offers a different interpretation of Berlin. The paper critically assesses the extent to which it is possible to escape from pro-growth agendas in developing an urban future for the city and explores some of the implications of Berlin’s current development trajectory.",,"Research Article"

Growing flows of refugees and immigrants call into question the state-centred identities and narratives of nationally bounded cultures. In the current situation a more cosmopolitan view is needed instead of the established, exclusive concept of place.

In this paper the debate over eastern enlargement is related directly to a shift within the EU from a dual focus on global economic competitiveness and the compensation of lagging regions to an increasingly singular focus on European competitiveness. Seen in this light, the goal of a single Europe with relatively similar levels of development everywhere is being replaced by an emerging threefold division of the continent into a ‘core’ Europe (itself increasingly differentiated across policy areas), a ‘peripheral’ Europe of potential eastern members perpetually on the road to full membership, and an ‘external’ Europe excluded from membership but open to use by businesses from the core. This geographical taxonomy rests on the growing reliance of the EU on a neo-liberal economic ideology that sees uneven development within Europe as helping the global competitiveness of the EU as a whole, using the model of the United States as its inspiration.",eastern enlargement;European Union;neo-liberalism;uneven development,"Research Article"

To do this, the paper examines paid informal work, a form of work conventionally conceptualized as low-paid employment heavily imbued with profit motivations on the part of both the consumer and supplier. Using structured interviews with 400 households in UK lower-income urban neighbourhoods, however, this paper shows that most paid informal exchange is seldom undertaken by either purchasers or suppliers to achieve maximum money gains. Instead, it is mostly conducted for and by close social relations for reasons associated with redistribution and sociality. In line with recent developments in economic geography associated with the ‘cultural turn/s’, therefore, this paper points not only to the social-embeddedness of paid informal exchange but also to how, at least in these UK lower-income neighbourhoods, the increasing penetration of monetary exchange has not marched hand-in-hand with market relations. In this extensive and growing sphere of monetary exchange, the profit motive is largely absent. Consequently, rather than construing paid informal work as the ultimate manifestation of unbridled profit-motivated capitalism, this paper instead shows such work to be a large alternative economic space within contemporary capitalism where monetary exchange is embedded in alternative social relations, motivations and pricing mechanisms.",cultural turn;deprived neighbourhoods;economic geography;informal sector,"Research Article"

To date, discussions on urban planning have mostly ignored the fact that this ‘millennium urbanism’ also requires a lot of ‘discursive planning’, especially about the production of a place-identity and an urban imaginary. Discursive planning means staging the social meaning of urban space through texts, photographs, and visual signs. Aesthetic urban planning is not only about creating ambient surroundings, but also creating images, symbolic representations, and fantasies discursively using books and advertising, newspapers and television, research, and political agendas. These discursive practices are used to signify an identifiable and/or imaginary place-identity to form a sense of place or feeling of belonging to place.

Discourses about postsocialist urban identity frequently attempt to `Europeanize' these cities' identity and to obscure elements of the `unwanted past', particularly the socialist, Soviet and Russian pasts. However, those pasts can return to disrupt dominant narratives of postsocialist urban identity. This article analyses how the past of socialism and relationships with Russia and the Soviet Union are treated in the construction of new urban identities in postsocialist CEE, particularly in the case of Łódź, Poland. After outlining the treatment of the socialist past in Polish society and politics, the article analyses the contested construction of a new identity for Łódź. The analysis focuses on the construction of a past multicultural `European' `Golden Age' for the city to create a new identity for it, and how that identity is contested and disrupted by the re-emergence of the city's socialist past and the history of its relations with Russia and the Soviet Union.The article concludes by outlining the broader implications of the case-study for the understanding of postsocialist urban identity formation.",Łódź;Poland;postsocialism;socialist past;urban identity,"Research Article"

An analytical matrix is provided and applied to New Accession Countries, with special consideration being given to French suppliers' circumstances due to the requirement that host country characteristics and company specificities be analysed simultaneously. The second section tests this matrix using statistical data and culminates in a case-study. It will be demonstrated that New Accession Countries are being integrated with the rest of the Continent, due to firms' ongoing search for location-related advantages and because of a tightening/easing interaction that is associated with proximity constraints.",automotive;division of labour;modular production;New Accession Countries;suppliers,"Research Article"

Major points of discussion will be the hypothesis of a `hollowingout' of the Western European auto industry, and the hypothesis of a `regime flight'; that is, the claim that companies use CEE locations to escape the collectively regulated work models of Western Europe. The article draws from our own empirical research, including company case-studies in Western and Eastern auto plants, and on statistical analysis. The main conclusions are: in CEE countries, an upgrading process of production sites can be observed, which challenges the view of an emerging `high end/low end' division of labour between the West and the East.While relocation has led to some losses of low-skill jobs in Western Europe, the overall effect of the expansion of the automotive industry to CEE on growth and employment in Western Europe was positive.The impact of low-cost component imports from CEE countries has increased the competitiveness of the German firms, which are by far the main investor in CEE countries. Our case-studies reveal no trend towards regime flight from Western European work models, but management threats of relocation have become commonplace and have led to a renegotiation of work models in Western European countries. In CEE countries, the work models of automobile companies more and more are oriented at a high-road path.This development is fostered by the companies' responses to the problems of migration and the increasing shortage of skilled labour.",automotive industry;Central and Eastern Europe;division of labour;relocation;work models,"Research Article"

Drawing on secondary materials and interviews with senior officials in transnational and domestic temporary staffing agencies, labour unions, industry trade bodies and government departments, the article asserts that the temporary staffing industry should be understood as an active agent of labour market restructuring. It provides a detailed analysis of the Swedish industry's distinct periods of expansion, charting its legalization and subsequent growth in the context of a highly regulated labour market. In conclusion, the article makes two key points. First, the Swedish temporary staffing market is the product of a particular social democratic welfare state regime and the roles played by the different social partners which lead to the production of a managed flexibility. Second, the particularities of the Swedish system, and the need for transnational staffing agencies to adapt their activities, underline how firms both shape, and are shaped by, the economic and social characteristics and dynamics that exist in the territories in which they invest.",labour markets;national systems;regulation;Sweden;temporary staffing industry,"Research Article"

Increased production by both foreign and domestic manufacturers in the wider Marmara region has also resulted in a concentration of service sector firms in the greater Istanbul metropolitan area. Examination of the profile of foreign investors and investment categories reveals that Germany and the Netherlands remain major sources of investment, and that investment from these two countries shows the most marked signs of functional linkage between manufacturing and service projects. This growth of functional linkage, exemplified by the increased importance of logistics operations, may represent the removal of one more factor inhibiting inward investment into Turkey on a scale appropriate to its size and growth potential.",automotive sector;foreign direct investment;Istanbul;logistics;Turkey,"Research Article"

For this reason these countries are becoming interesting cases for a comparison of the processes of settlement, integration and conflict experienced by immigrants. Even though a comprehensive comparative analysis among European states is not entirely feasible, we can already notice certain characteristics of immigrant settlements as well as the trajectories of their social and geographic mobility. This article is mostly centred on the Italian context and discusses three themes: recent immigration in some industrial districts, female immigrants as care workers in urban centres, and finally emerging/changing social conflicts as a direct consequence of immigration fluxes. The Italian cases illustrated in this article suggest the emergence of forms of territorial settlement which are not very segregated, but may in any event be potentially conflictual. In this respect I will discuss the growing economic competition among different types of immigrant entrepreneurs, the segregation and discrimination of immigrant children in schools, and finally the ethno-spatial conflicts which recently came to the fore in Milan.",domestic labour;households;immigration;industrial districts;Italy;Roma people;segregation;welfare state,"Research Article"

The article explains such dependency by drawing on interview material collected from employers, employers' associations, community organizations and policymakers. In sum, we argue that London's Migrant Division of Labour (MDL) is a product of the semi-autonomous actions taken by employers, workers and government in the particular context of London. Understanding the MDL thus needs to encompass employer demand, migrants' `dual frame of reference' and limited access to benefits, as well as employers' preference for foreign-born workers over `native' labour supply.The state is also argued to play a critical role in this employment, determining the nature and terms of immigration, the accessibility and levels of benefits, and employment regulation. London's MDL is shown to intersect with, and in some cases overturn, existing patterns of labour market segmentation on the basis of human capital (class), ethnicity and gender.",global city labour markets;hiring queue;immigration;London;low-paid work;migrant division of labour;migrant labour,"Research Article"

In this article we review how existing literatures provide insights that can be used to understand the role of business travel as international labour mobility in the contemporary professional service economy. In doing so, we reach the conclusion that there seem to be at least two significant voids preventing a more sophisticated understanding from emerging. First, we suggest that international business travel needs to be studied not in isolation but instead as one component in a wider ecology of mobility which `produces' the global firm. Second, we argue that it is important to know more about the time-space dynamics of international business travel in terms of how spatial relations are produced and reproduced by different forms and geographies of travel. We make these arguments and explore their implications using data collected through interviews in advertising, architecture and legal professional service firms.We conclude by identifying a research agenda designed to allow a better understanding of business travel to emerge in corporate and mobility discourses.",business travel;Europe;mobility;professional services,"Research Article"

A geographical approach to justice and equity must consider the interaction of place distributions and people distributions of income and opportunity. Place and people distributions may conflict with one another. Moreover, different such distributions have different impacts on economic efficiency and thus on aggregate output.

In the years to come, developed country growth is likely to remain slow because no alternative high-growth model is on the horizon. A country such as China conversely has the potential to continue to grow relatively fast provided it can profoundly alter its model of development in ways that address global and national imbalances. If it and other large emerging economies do achieve further sustained growth, this will in effect reverse the gap created by industrial revolution, colonialism and imperialism.

In this paper we investigate the importance of regional industry structure for regional productivity convergence. We use county data for the Scandinavian Peninsula.

The data cover five-year intervals from 1980 to 2000 for Norway and from 1985 for Sweden. We find strong productivity convergence between Norwegian counties and weak divergence between Swedish ones. The effect of the industry structure on the spatial distribution of productivity appears to be small in magnitude, but it is qualitatively important. Moreover, the role played by the changing composition of production in the process of economic growth seems to differ over time. By implication, considerable caution should be exercised when undertaking convergence studies based on the commonly used one-sector growth model. More complex models allowing for differences in industry structure, and possibly also other potentially important factors such as wealth effects and transitional dynamics, should be considered.",comparative study;European regions;Norway;productivity convergence;Sweden,"Other"

To do this, the paper develops a cultural politics of scales approach that compares the discursive (re)construction of the North/South divide in Italy and England by focusing on key moments, particularly the Keynesian consensus after the Second World War and the more current turn to neoliberal policies. Two parallel trends are identified: that support for an interventionist state and regional subsidies to poorer regions has decreased and that the North/South divide as a dual national partition has been dissolved into a micro-diverse geography.

This paper examines the role envisaged for the Opera House in Oslo, which opened in April 2008. The study looks at the motivations and justifications for the building, examined through interviews with individuals who played an important role in the project. Research findings suggest that the Opera House is best understood as a cultural and national symbol, although it was also designed to assist urban regeneration and development. One of the interesting aspects of the project is the way artistic and regeneration justifications were coupled to ensure the project came to fruition. Other roles seem to have emerged that were not necessarily planned or expected. Tourism effects have been witnessed and its innovative design means the new Opera House functions as both a marketing symbol and a visitor attraction in its own right. The case demonstrates the value of focusing good urban design, with the possible bonus of external image enhancement, rather than relying on an iconic building and a ‘look at me’ effect. Thus, the Opera House may represent a less speculative type of iconic building — where bombastic design and external focus are replaced with more attention to public access and a local orientation.",flagships;icons;marketing;regeneration;waterfronts,"Other"

Under policy frameworks such as the European Neighbourhood Policy and the EU’s Global Approach to Migration, a process of economic and political regional integration is under way that is beginning to transform the ways in which non-accession neighbours and neighbours of neighbours in North Africa and beyond are articulated with the EU. Central to these changes are programmes, institutions and practices of both regional economic development and border routes management. This changing geopolitical and geo-economic approach to regional integration and the nature of European borderlands has at its heart a series of new spatial imaginaries, institutional actors and cartographic experiments that point to a project in process in which the relationships between territory, state and population are being reconfigured to produce new notions of sovereignty across more complex and multiple borders and, in some cases, beyond borders.",Border externalization;cartography;European Union;foreign policy;regional integration;sovereignty,"Research Article"

We argue that, although there exists by now a vast literature by geographers and other scholars that engages with the production of ‘EU’ropean spaces through regionalization, the policy literature generated by EU ‘macro-regional experts’ appears to entirely ignore these debates, professing an understanding of regions that is a conceptual pastiche at best, and that entirely occludes the political and geopolitical implications of region-making within, at, and beyond ‘EU’rope’s borders",Borders;Europe;European Union;Mediterranean;regions,"Research Article"

Through access to high level diplomats, politicians and EU Commission staff involved in preparing and negotiating Icelandic accession to the EU, we examine the difficulties for both sides of overcoming the country’s long-standing antipathy towards European political integration and appeasing the vociferous sectoral interests, especially in farming and fisheries, ranged against membership. The significance of this application far outstrips the size of this small island state since Iceland’s relationship with ‘EUrope’ is long-standing and complex. This national drama is given greater political salience as it is projected against the backdrop of ‘EUrope’s own existential struggles over the post-1945 political project of integration currently underway. Ultimately the saga of Iceland’s membership of the EU may be a relatively short one if Iceland refuses ‘EUrope’, which would effectively mark the final frontier of ‘EUropean’ expansion northwards. This would also mark a distinct stage in the history of ‘European ‘external relations; a candid assessment by a small island state of the value of adopting the structures and policies of an alleged ‘New ‘EUrope’.",Enlargement;EU;external relations;Iceland;political geography,"Research Article"

As the EU has sought to control flows of people, money and goods through these new borders, it has also become a destination for irregular migrants and small-scale traders from its eastern neighbours. This article draws upon participant observation in one such community in western Ukraine, where continuing levels of high unemployment and low wages and pensions drive dependence on flows of remittances from migrants to southern Europe, but also revenues from small-scale trade with neighbouring EU members, such as Romania. New forms of transnational mobility have emerged, which are not gender-neutral. The article asserts that, while hegemonic masculinities exist in both Ukrainian and Romanian communities, gender relations in Romania are restricted by sexualised discourses. As male and female Ukrainian traders interact with Romanian border officials and local distributors and intermediaries, hegemonic masculinities in Ukraine are re-affirmed and female traders are unable to advance and develop their trade in the same way as their male counterparts. In doing so, the article expands research on gender and transnationalism in post-enlargement Europe beyond migration and demonstrates not only how encounters at the EU’s borders are shaping gender relations in communities outside the EU, but that involvement in cross-border economic activities is determined by the gendered discourses and performance that take place at the border.",Borders;Europe;gender;informal economy;post-socialism,"Research Article"

However, although the Egyptian revolution may seem the most obvious driving force behind the growth of unions on the country’s docks, these advances also conform to a regional pattern. Since 2007 a campaign by the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF) has seen new unions formed and collective bargaining rights won in many ports across the region, including in Bahrain, Jordan and Morocco. It is argued that the technical and industrial resources made available through the ITF’s activities and networks have, therefore, played an important role.

Greenbaum;Jen Nelles;Frédéric Durand;,2014,46,140,"Rural regions in Europe are facing diverging pathways of development. On the one hand, the influence of urbanisation and the intensification and continued up-scaling of agriculture make it more difficult for many regions to remain distinctive and increase sustainability. Places, as well as goods and services, have become increasingly interchangeable. For many regions an obvious choice is to compete with other regions for global mobile capital and labour. On the other hand, and as a counterforce to these global logics, new strategies, which are more place-based, are being developed, such as the construction of identities or images around new agricultural goods and services. These strategies can be seen in the context of the ‘New Rural Paradigm’ for European rural regions. In the search for new trajectories for sustainable development, different models can be identified: the bio-economy paradigm and the eco-economy. Each model has its own sustainability claim and can be analysed in the context of the overarching development theory of ecological modernisation. The central question in this article is what types of strategies and pathways for eco-economic development can be witnessed in rural regions in Europe? The empirical analysis is based on 62 European cases. Three key eco-economic strategies that show a shift from an agricultural-based development to a more integrative rural and regionally based development are identified. The article concludes with some consistent parameters for understanding the dynamic complexity of rural regional development.",Branding;eco-economy;new rural paradigm;regional development;regional strategies;rural development;sustainability,"Research Article"

Greenbaum;Jen Nelles;Frédéric Durand;,2014,0,85,"Recent decades have been dominated by discourses describing a resurgence of regions. Yet despite its prominence the region remains a largely Delphian concept. In the period of new regionalist orthodoxy, for example, while it was recognized that regions take various forms, the normative claim that we were living in a ‘regional world’ became narrowly focused on regions as subnational political units. Nevertheless, the emergence of city-regions, cross-border regions, and European Metropolitan Regions is leading some scholars to suggest the formation in this century of a brave new ‘regional world’. With economic, social and political activity increasingly orchestrated through regional spaces that cross-cut the territorial map that prevailed through much of the twentieth century, the literature is adorned with accounts advancing the theoretical and policy rationale for relational approaches to regions and regionalism. Yet far less has been written on the struggle to construct these spaces politically, thereby neglecting questions of territory and territorial politics. With this in mind, our paper draws on the experience of Germany to consider the political struggle to overcome the contradictions, overlaps, and competing tendencies that result from new regional spaces appearing alongside, rather than replacing, existing forms of state scalar organization. In particular, we observe how the Federal State is using the ambiguity of the regional concept to present territorial and relational approaches as complementary alternatives. The paper concludes by relating these findings to ongoing debates on how we, as ‘regional’ researchers, should approach the analysis of regions and regionalism; speculates on the degree to which they form progressive and effective spatial policies; and asks what lessons can be learnt about contemporary state spatiality more generally.",European Metropolitan Regions;Germany;networks;planning;regions;territory,"Research Article"

Isolated from an initial and non-discriminate England-wide clustering analysis of 73 Audit Commission-defined quality of life indicators, the results of our study reveal that pivotal to London’s prevailing quality of life distribution is the influence of deprivation, health and educational inequalities, all of which are masked at a pure ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ London comparison, capable only of distinguishing the city’s borough-level transport and community safety diversity.

By using data from a large northern Italian region, the analysis yields employment impact estimates of the policies under plausible identification assumptions. The paper finds no significant difference between the employment impacts of ERDF co-funded and national/regional programs, whereas, regardless of the funding body, the absolute per-firm employment effects of the programs are increasingly larger the higher the economic value of the incentives. However, the most generous incentives come with a much higher cost per each additional new job. The analysis also shows that the absolute per-firm employment effects of soft loans are similar to those of capital grants, but, because soft loans cost much less, they are more effective from a policy perspective.",Counterfactual impact evaluation;enterprise support programs;grants;loans;regional economic development,"Research Article"

These policies are part of processes of de-bordering and political rescaling that have profoundly affected cross-border areas by creating new institutional territories and political structures. The purpose of this paper is to study the institutional history of cross-border metropolitan governance in Europe through the comparison of two of the most advanced cross-border metropolitan regions: Lille and Luxembourg. This paper asks how these cross-border structures have developed and changed. What can their patterns of institutional evolution contribute to understanding governance in other cross-border regions? Are these new spaces evidence of political rescaling? This paper presents and redefines cross-border governance as a cyclical and a long-term process and also explores the challenges that these partnerships face in becoming functionally effective and autonomous policy actors. Ultimately, we find that there is no replicable ideal of cross-border governance and that even long-standing partnerships are in a period of exploration and reinvention. Establishing a competitive and coherent cross-border metropolitan region is ambitious and complex, and it necessitates the coordination of policies at multiple scales and across institutionally diverse territories. This project requires the modification and/or construction of new institutional and legal frameworks. This reorientation of political attention has resulted in a reconceptualization of political space but not the empowerment of new political actors, indicating that the process of rescaling may be a work in progress.",Cross-border cooperation;cross-border governance;cross-border metropolitan region;political and territorial rescaling,"Research Article"

Contrary to the dominant rhetoric, austerity measures and pacts imposed on Greece, Portugal, Spain – and later Cyprus – do not seem to provide effective remedies. On the contrary, they seem to plunge entire areas and groups of people into a vicious cycle of rising unemployment, shrinking incomes and deep impoverishment. In the context of this rhetoric, an almost exclusive emphasis on the macro-economic aspects of the crisis, seems to “expel” from public debate the fact that there are effects of austerity policies that are unevenly distributed, inscribed as they are on existing inequalities: inequalities among places, between women and men, locals and migrants, big and small employers, secure and precarious workers and, most importantly, intersections of these. This paper engages with some of the less debated aspects of the crisis in Athens, with a focus on the complex and usually invisible ways in which it impacts on women. It draws upon research in a low-income neighbourhood of Athens and focuses on changes in women’s everyday lives, which have to do with job precarity and job loss, destruction of social services and the re-shaping of care, as well as practices of coping with/resisting the crisis.",Care;Greek crisis;precarity;urban neighbourhoods;women,"Research Article"

New multi-lateral and bi-lateral agreements on border management have been forged between the EU, its member states, and its North African neighbours and neighbours-of-neighbours. In the process, what is meant by the ‘border’ is being transformed with implications for where the border is located, who has jurisdiction over particular spaces, and how border and migration management is undertaken. This paper analyses the spatial logics of EU border externalization practices as they are being applied to and in North and West Africa. It focuses on Operation Seahorse and the transnationally coordinated border control projects and infrastructures implemented by the Guardia Civil of Spain. Seahorse serves as an implementation case of the Migration Routes Initiative, an approach toward migration management emphasizing interregional cooperation between designated origin-transit-destination countries. The initiative is the organizing strategy of the Global Approach to Migration, the EU’s overarching framework toward migration policy. The paper shows how Seahorse is changing migration policy and re-articulating Europe’s relations with African countries, producing new bordering processes, creating new geographies of integration and border management, and redefining the practices of territory, sovereignty, and extra-territoriality.",Border externalization;Euro-Med;migration;routes management;Spain,"Research Article"

It is assumed that local welfare provision is more efficient and less expensive than centralised national welfare programmes. In this article we argue first that the process of transformation and localisation of welfare is driven by two different (sometimes opposing) forces: (1) the necessity to identify effective ways of responding to the need for social support which is increasingly individualised, fragmented and heterogeneous, and therefore to expand ‘active’ social policies; and (2) the necessity to keep under control (and more often reducing) national public spending. Second, we argue that a more integrated welfare system (involving the third sector, voluntary organisations and private providers) and one which is more locally differentiated poses a series of problems in terms of social and territorial inequalities. We then identify some conditions that can help to keep inequalities under control. In the conclusion we will see how the crisis is exacerbating these tendencies.",Local welfare;social and territorial inequalities;social rights;social protection;governance,"Research Article"

The hotel industry is one of the most striking examples. Given that the hotel sector is much more global in terms of number of countries covered by each company than many other service industries, one of the crucial aspects of hotel sector globalisation that requires attention from a geographical perspective is the territorial embeddedness of expanding hotel groups in the variety of institutional, political and economic contexts. Grounded in the global production networks (GPNs) approach, this paper aims to address this lacuna in empirical and theoretical terms. Drawing from extensive research carried out in Poland, Estonia and Bulgaria, the paper examines the impact of post-communist transformations on the expansion of international hotel groups into Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and analyses how different hotel GPNs interact with the various contexts across the region. It is argued that the ways in which post-communist transformations influence the expansion of hotel groups into CEE depend upon the degree of territorial embeddedness of the hotel group, which, in turn, is reflective of the group’s business model and the architecture of its GPN. In theoretical terms, the paper illustrates how, to better account for the particularities of CEE, the GPN approach can incorporate the ‘alternative approach’ – the theory of post-communist transformations that challenges the neoliberal orthodoxy which drove the post-communist restructuring in the 1990s.",Central and Eastern Europe (CEE);global production networks (GPNs);post-communist transformations;the alternative approach;the international hotel industry,"Research Article"

Using a comparative approach, the cases of Basel, Geneva and Luxembourg are singled out. The confrontation between German, Swiss and French state policies, and the modalities of the rescaling of levels of governance within the three cross-border metropolitan regions, allows us to underline the considerable influence of national guidelines on scalar reconfigurations.

It is argued that as a result of the emphasis on competitiveness, marketing-oriented promotional representations are now becoming emphasized in region-building.

Different models of urban dispersion have been identified during the investigated period by correlating variables such as population density, land-use and territorial characteristics to the sprawl index. This index significantly diverged in the two regions, suggesting that recent urbanization patterns are influenced by the city’s form.

The central crux of this paper is that convergence/divergence trends in European states are conditioned by ‘state capacity’. State capacity – which we define here as a combination of impartial bureaucratic practices, corruption and the rule of law – limits, and in some cases reverses the tendency towards greater divergence linked to trade. Countries with high levels of state capacity – that is, those that have greater government effectiveness, stronger rule of law and lower corruption – experience lower levels of divergence, as they have the mechanisms to counterbalance the strong centripetal forces linked to openness. This claim is tested on countries that have experienced relatively high levels of increases in levels of economic and political globalisation – European Union (EU) member states – using aggregated regional-level data from 1995 to 2008. Strong and robust empirical evidence is found for this claim.",Convergence;Europe;globalisation;regions;state capacity,"Research Article"

The third section of the article performs a fuzzy sets/Qualitative Comparative Analysis to identify the main factors that bolster the regionalisation of business associations. By way of conclusion, there are two routes towards successful regional business mobilisation.

Secondly, it analyses how migrant workers are recruited, and finds less evidence to support the concepts of ethnic queuing and co-ethnic recruitment as opposed to diversified migrant recruitment in the context of the super-diversity of migrant populations in a global city. Finally, it demonstrates that although there are compelling reasons for migrant employment in London’s small hotels, and that this is supported by a number of recruitment practices, they are unevenly distributed across establishments, reflecting the complex nature of migrant employment in a highly diverse sub-sector.

Most of today’s literature on the subject takes cultural clusters as a single type and focuses on aspects linked to their urban planning or economic impact. However, there is a growing awareness of the importance of the social dimension of cultural clusters. This paper aims to differentiate between various cultural clusters in the city of Barcelona by constructing models or types of cluster, taking into account the predominant interaction dynamics and the type of social ties generated between the cultural agents participating in these groupings. Following these criteria we distinguish three types of cultural cluster according to whether a bureaucratic, associative or community dynamic predominates.

Although amalgamation was one of the recommended strategies, as a consequence of the European Union/International Monetary Fund bailout process, an alternative approach has been suggested. This reform is mostly a development of inter-municipal cooperation mechanisms combined with partial devolution strategies. However, as the bailout agreement was its main catalyst, the urgency to cut public administration costs required in the memorandum and the imposed deadlines gave a perverse incentive for central government to produce ad hoc and fragmented modifications. I argue that these political and economical demands, which sanctioned the argument for rushed measures, together with the country’s strong local identities, historical municipalism, political centralism and the political costs of significant territorial changes, can explain the absence of a comprehensible reform strategy and the singularities of its policies.

Entities developed to foster cross-border cooperation, such as working communities and Euroregions, are conceived as mechanisms of democratisation through the decentralisation of regional or/and local governmental bodies. However, scholarly debate suggests that the top-down policy-making process that is characteristic of cross-border programmes seems to cast doubt on the fulfilment of a European participatory democracy. In this respect, the cross-border cooperation process seems to contribute an added value to the dilemma of the European democratic deficit. The objective of this paper is to present a regional contribution to this debate through a study of local experts’ perspectives on the implementation and impact of cross-border cooperation policies in the southern Portugal–Spain border region and the possibilities for local and social participation. This paper utilises data from two related investigations in the southern cross-border area between Portugal and Spain, including qualitative interviews, focus groups and content analysis of secondary data. The results reveal a positive attitude towards the recent regional top-down initiatives of European integration, although local experts question the potential for the inclusion of local perspectives in cross-border initiatives. In addition, during this period of economic crisis, political contradictions may be observed, and political initiatives related to the Spanish–Portuguese border may hamper the existing cross-border flows and dynamics of progressive integration. In this sense, local authorities play an important role as the nexus between transnational institutions of cross-border cooperation and the inhabitants of border regions.",Cross-border cooperation;democratic deficit;European integration;Euroregion;local/social participation;regionalism,"Research Article"

Overviews of post-socialist transformation can conflate daily informal payments to bureaucrats made by citizens with high-level political corruption. Micro-study analyses frame informal payments within a binary of ex-ante ‘insurance’ or ex-post ‘gratitude’, embedded within an economistic transactional frame. In contrast, this article takes a ‘social function’ approach, examining transactions for what they reveal about parties’ evaluations of personhood, both of the giver and receiver. Street-level bureaucrats and citizens engage in socially grounded negotiation whereby payment is assessed within a needs–means spectrum. The more needy, the smaller the payment; the greater the means, the greater the payment. This is an efficacy-affective form of redistribution and welfare functioning against a backdrop of the dysfunctional state’s refusal to act as social welfare guarantor. It reveals a degree of structuring from below of the qualitative intervention by the state in the lives of citizens, even as distrust and despair in post-socialist societies due to the retreat of the state from its duties towards citizens reach ever higher levels.",Corruption;informal payments;moral economy;personhood;Russia;Ukraine,"Research Article"

It argues that understanding this type of cross-border co-operation requires a focus on the way in which professionals define and apply their professional standards in cross-border contexts. Moreover, it requires a focus on individual organizations and professionals working in them, rather than ‘government’ or ‘the state’ as a whole, since cross-border co-operation in these areas typically develops as a result of disparate and unconnected initiatives taken by governmental actors in a given border region. Based on four studies of cross-border co-operation in Dutch border regions, we argue that differences in legal, organizational and cultural backgrounds between the participating countries can be and are overcome by street-level professionals and their organizations, who act as ‘regionauts’ in exploring opportunities for cross-border co-operation. In this type of ‘bottom-up’ cross-border co-operation, motivation among participants is the key to establishing co-operation, and solutions to differences between work routines will be developed along the way. As a result, the establishment of cross-border co-operation often is an experimental, pragmatic enterprise, which is greatly affected by local intra- and inter-organizational dynamics. This opens the potential for pragmatic, flexible and creative solutions. Yet, at the same time it also runs the risk of producing unaccountable cross-border arrangements that are insufficiently embedded in legal and professional safeguards against error and abuse.",Cross-border co-operation;cross-border governance;European Union;professionals;regionauts;soft spaces,"Research Article"

The concept on which this study is based is path dependence understood in terms of its function in explaining the creation of institutions in societal life. The aim of this article was to determine the sustainability of trans-border partnerships initiated within the framework of the PHARE CBC Programme in Poland. Three major rules governing the system of cooperation in border regions in Poland have been identified in the course of this analysis: the dependence of the activities of organisations cooperating in border regions on external financing; a lack of cross-border organisations recognised as border-region hosts whose position would entitle them to make key decisions concerning the whole area under research; and the significance of the border-region and attractive neighbour locational rent for territorial cooperation."",Border regions;cooperation;institutionalization;path dependence;PHARE CBC;sustainability,"Research Article"

In immigrant entrepreneurship research, the key role of co-ethnic networks has been particularly highlighted. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the networking practices of immigrants who start businesses in a rural context where co-ethnic communities do not exist. In order to address this gap, this article highlights the experiences of female Russian immigrant entrepreneurs living in Finnmark in northernmost Norway. Finnmark in fact represents a particularly interesting geographical context for such an empirical focus. The article considers how social, economic and cultural contexts configure network relationships and reveals the important role of the family, and in particular the male spouse, representing a network of resources that may alleviate migrant disadvantage through affective ties. Moreover, it shows that the family of the immigrant entrepreneurs may be located both locally in the new context of settlement and transnationally in the country of origin, and in addition may be of both co-ethnic and cross-ethnic character.",Bonding and bridging;family embeddedness;immigrant female entrepreneurship;local and transnational;rural context;social networking;spousal support,"Research Article"

Building on the idea of cultural production as a reflexive economic activity and on three empirical vignettes about how culture, the economy and the city interact, it argues that cultural production is an adaptable activity which is, however, permanently forced into a state of adaptation. Urban space and society have an ambivalent role here.

Recent debates on policy mobilities opened a fruitful discussion on how policies are transferred from one place to another and the complex processes that rework places and policies in heterogeneous ways. While we are sympathetic to this literature, there are theoretical and empirical gaps to be addressed. It is frequently stated that processes around the transfer and grounding of policies are complex, and that outcomes are far from secure. However, the empirical focus in most cases is on transfers that are more or less “successful”, or at least portrayed as being successful by their advocates. In contrast to this “success bias” in research and public discourse, we argue that it is helpful to focus more closely on failures, resistances and contradictions. Judging from work on the transfer of BIDs – an almost classical example of successfully mobilized urban policies – we argue that it is helpful to reflect on unfinished policy mobilities, that is, the failure of mobilized urban policies.",Business Improvement Districts;Germany;neoliberalism;policy mobilities;urban development,"Research Article"

The paper is set in the context of competing claims on the more transformative effects of inward investment with some stressing that notions of a ‘new regionalism’ in Wales have been unjustly founded on assumptions about the transforming effects of foreign investment. There is also a problem of a paucity of research showing how foreign investment had been involved in evolutionary processes of regional economic change. The paper shows that a more complete appreciation of the role of inward investment needs to consider not only its role in job creation but also the relative stability of the investment and jobs attracted. The paper reveals how analysis of plant birth and deaths also links through to perspectives offered by evolutionary economic geography, and how patterns of entry and exit might work to influence the economic trajectories of a disadvantaged region such as Wales.",Foreign manufacturing;hazard functions;regional policy;survival rates;Wales,"Research Article"

While the condition is widespread across Europe, its spatial and social distribution is highly uneven. In this paper, the existence of a geographical energy poverty divide in the European Union (EU) provides a starting point for conceptualizing and exploring the relationship between energy transitions – commonly described as wide-ranging processes of socio-technical change – and existing patterns of regional economic inequality. We have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of spatial and temporal trends in the national-scale patterns of energy poverty, as well as gas and electricity prices. The results of our work indicate that the classic economic development distinction between the core and periphery also holds true in the case of energy poverty, as the incidence of this phenomenon is significantly higher in Southern and Eastern European EU Member States. The paper thus aims to provide the building blocks for a novel theoretical integration of questions of path-dependency, uneven development and material deprivation in existing interpretations of energy transitions.",Energy poverty;energy transition;European Union;prices;regional inequalities,"Research Article"

This is made possible by linking gross employment flows to the notion of regional resilience. Our findings indicate that despite a steady national employment growth, only the three metropolitan regions have fully recovered from the recession of 1990. Further, we show evidence of high levels of job creation and destruction in both declining and expanding regions and sectors, and that the creation of jobs is mainly attributable to employment growth in incumbent firms, while job destruction is primarily due to exits and micro-plants. Although the geography of resistance to crises and the ability of adaptability in the aftermath vary, our findings suggest that cohesive (i.e., with many skill-related industries) and diverse (i.e., with a high degree of unrelated variety) regions are more resilient over time. We also find that resistance to future shocks (e.g., the 2008 recession) is highly dependent on the resistance to previous crises. In all, this suggests that the long-term evolution of regional economies also influences their future resilience.",Crises, job creation, job destruction, regional economic evolution, regional resilience,"Research Article"

Finland is a part of the Nordic model that emphasises ‘family-friendly arrangements’, such as family leave for mothers and fathers. To date, there is little research on how parents use urban space on family leave, although it is known that fathers stay on family leave more often in urban areas. Based on a triangulation of qualitative data on the day-to-day life of mothers and fathers on family leave, the paper argues that particular place-dependent ways of being on family leave take place in the inner city. Mixed-use pavements in many ways help mothers and fathers to cope in their new life situation and break the isolation often associated with family leave. The data also shows the importance of family-friendly public and commercial places in the city, such as playgrounds and accessible grocery shops, cafeterias and restaurants. The paper concludes that there is a need to further explore the production side of the everyday practices of parents, and how they add to city life and participate in changing cityscapes.",Families;family leave;housing;inner cities;public space,"Research Article"

It is widely argued that there is a growing dissonance between the policy narratives and agendas found in metropolitan cities and amongst national governments. The former are characterised as being more pragmatic, tolerant and open in their approaches than the latter who, in many instances, have adopted more assimilationalist and nationalist rhetorics and policies. In exploring these governance dynamics, the paper builds on the work of Delanty to argue for a methodological approach grounded in what he terms critical cosmopolitanism, or a focus on the dynamic interactions between global and local influences on governmentalities and policy priorities. Much of the writing on critical cosmopolitanism has focused on questions of identity. This paper expands the concept and assesses its applicability to understandings and interpretations of urban politics and governance, through the lens of diversity narratives and the ways in which they are ‘fixed’ to broader political projects by regimes in different contexts. It argues that a range of meanings are being attached to ‘diversity’. In some instances, the term acts as a focus for more progressive forms of intervention. In others, however, it is being used to justify divisive forms of growth politics or acts as a lightning rod for existing discontents. The paper concludes by reflecting on the impacts of recent anti-globalisation and immigration politics across Europe and the fragility of existing fixes and policy assumptions.",Cosmopolitanism;diversity;governance;regimes;urban policy,"Research Article"

Due to increasing regionalism efforts within European Union (EU) member states and to the fact that EU legislation is affecting subnational authorities more and more directly, these authorities are not only striving for influence in the national arena, but in the European arena as well. The primary task of a public affairs (PA) practitioner working for a regional government in the EU is placing regional interests on national and European political agendas. However, since regional PA is a rather young discipline, opposite to PA in the private sector and in national government, much is unknown about the way regional PA practitioners are operating in the national and European political arenas, and how these arenas are receiving the subnational PA practitioners. In this study, 41 Dutch PA practitioners and PA receivers were interviewed about their opinions on and experiences with regional PA in both arenas: What are the relevant characteristics of these arenas for regional PA activities, and how are regional PA practitioners managing arena characteristics? The results show that at the national level, it is a struggle to find recognition for regional issues, due to dominant high-profiled regions, centralisation tendencies at the national level and a more general non-subnational attitude. At the European level, regional issues are more welcome, but regional PA practitioners have to overcome the dominant national interests of member states.",Arena characteristics;arena interaction;regional policy;regional public affairs,"Research Article"

We present, firstly, the EU Quarter as a fixed setting for policy making with a relatively constant physical, locational and functional shape, and a specific sense of place as the EU bubble. Secondly, we emphasise the fragmentation and fluidity that portray it as a place divided into various political assemblages that make the place an assemblage of assemblages consisting of smaller and constantly evolving sub-processes. Thirdly, we aim to demonstrate the mobile and geographically distributed nature of EU policy making, and thus the dispersal of the political places where it takes place. This generates mobility of different kinds, which include not only the circulation of political ideas and people between different sites of the EU political system, but also the monthly migration of the Parliament and related lobbyists to Strasbourg. We believe that these three aspects of political place help the understanding of the situated but simultaneously spatially dispersed and mobile nature of EU policy making, and the study of the political places in other urban contexts.",Political place;EU policy;Brussels;political assemblages;fluid space,"Research Article"

However, for city-regions, knowledge is often a scarce resource due to the small size of the policy community, context-specific issues, limited availability of resources and experts, as well as the challenge of addressing complex issues that are often supra-local. This paper explores which patterns of local knowledge promote policy change and learning. Starting from the ‘policy paradigm’ concept, a cognitive–evolutionary approach is applied to analyse Brussels’ water management policy, which aims to address the major challenge of flooding. The variety of knowledge by local actors, the role of the policy paradigm of the local policymaking community in vetting information and evaluating alternative solutions, and the importance of local governments for retaining knowledge, are the main dimensions to understanding policy change and learning. City-regions benefit from direct contacts between actors facilitating exchange of knowledge, while supra-local decisions (e.g. EU directives) and local accidents can also trigger major changes. Based on my findings, policymakers tend to rely on technocratic patterns using already available knowledge, mainly whether decentralisation reshapes the policymaking community. While a technocratic pattern determines only minor changes and institutional instability undermines policy learning, policy entrepreneurs and participative patterns can promote major changes and learning if they are able to engage in dialogue with the dominant policy paradigm.",Policy change and learning;knowledge;policy paradigm;Brussels;water;decentralisation;policymaking;city-region,"Research Article"

However, there were aspects of it that flirted with positively charged notions of Swedish national identity. It was also clear that the discursive struggle for a living countryside was also part of a party-political struggle.

Particularly in terms of intellectual property rights (IPR), however, little is known about how cities contribute to regional innovation: are they containers, facilitators or innovators? This is investigated here through empirical material derived from 27 interviews with top departmental management in three Finnish cities (Helsinki, Espoo and Vantaa). The results show that local city governments (LCGs) consider cities as facilitators of innovation activities but also admit that there are limits (time constraints and lack of resources) to the influence of LCGs over the innovation environment. Still, many of the public sector innovations (especially social innovations) that do not necessarily have a clear market potential would not have been created without the active role of LCGs as innovators. City employees are innovative – the seeming lack of public sector innovation is actually a result of measurement issues that favour (patentable) technological innovations rather than those more common to LCGs, meaning service and organisational types. Therefore, LCGs can be seen as highly innovative organisations. There are, however, barriers to innovation in the public sector, such as the cost of innovation activity, the lack of incentives for it and a working culture that does not support it. Lastly, the results show that LCGs have not really fully considered the possibilities and potential of owning their own IPR; to be specific, potentially lucrative opportunities should be explored.",Innovation;intellectual property rights;local government;patents;public sector,"Research Article"

Gentrification is a travelling concept with lingering attachments to the Anglo-American urban context. Three issues related to gentrification’s global reach are discussed in this paper. The first is the definition of gentrification. The simple definition adopted by the current gentrification research agenda leads us to accept gentrification’s global reach literally by definition. The second issue is the question of contextual boundaries. Boundaries that are too broad and ill-defined – such as the metropolis of the Global North versus the metropolis of the Global South – conceal what contextual difference may be about. The third issue is the reification of cultural differences, which may lead to them being used to explain attitudes towards gentrification, even though such attitudes could be explained by more prosaic socioeconomic motives compatible with Western rationalism. This paper concludes that the metamorphoses of gentrification through its different waves in the Anglophone world do not provide the script for understanding other cities’ urban histories and making sense of their urban restructuring processes. These cities must realize that new processes emerging under increasingly neoliberal policy orientations are regressive compared with previous arrangements, especially when they tend to exclude political alternatives. The Anglo-American world may have been a pioneering laboratory for the application of gentrification policies, but other parts of the world have shown more effective resistance that can be an asset in future struggles and sociopolitical arrangements and make a difference in people’s lives.",Abstraction;core and periphery;contextual diversity;gentrification;urban renewal,"Research Article"

Relatively long established and formal inter-urban networks of professionals of one sort or another have been joined by activists, consultants, financiers, lawyers and think tankers who have involved themselves in the arriving at, and making up of, urban policy. Through conferences, documents, knowledge banks, policy tourism, power-points and webinars, an emergent informational infrastructure has emerged to shape and structure the circulations and making of policy-making across a numbers of areas. From aging to creativity, climate change to drugs, education to transport, urban policies in different spheres have been rendered mobile. There is political work of adaptation, mediation and translation that has to be done to move policies from one location to another, of course. In some cases these policies appear in a range of locations, while in others they do not, a reminder – if one was needed – that those involved in the making up of policy are not always able to render all elements of the future under their control. This emphasis on the relational and territorial geographies of global-urban policy-making captures some of the issues facing those who lead cities.

It understands under-employment as an integral dimension of contemporary flexible labour trends, triggered by devaluation and expanding amid crisis, although in diverse geographical and sectoral terms. It follows a methodology that comparatively analyses statistical data, relevant secondary sources and previous case studies, before moving to a theoretical contextualization of the findings. Based on this framework, NUTS-II level total employment and part-time work data are analysed through location quotients, and a new embellishment of shift-share analysis is implemented for 2005–2008 and 2009–2012 across nine sectors. The findings reveal four distinct, although porous, patterns of under-employment that are distinguished according to different regional productive specializations and the impact of structural or regional effects. The reasons why some regional economies, such as the tourist ones, were more resistant to employment losses, and at the same time the most keen on expanding part-time work, are scrutinized. Concluding, three deeper causal mechanisms, namely productive-technological, organizational and institutional, that determine the under-employment patterns revealed, are discussed and contrasted to relevant literature findings.",Part-time work;shift-share analysis;regional patterns;under-employment casual mechanisms;Greek regions,"Research Article"

European cross-border regions created within this context are thus framed and characterized by the simultaneous dynamics of bordering and cross-border integration. This paper examines these two processes and the analysis is based on the representations of stakeholders from the Eurometropolis of Lille–Kortrijk–Tournai. It highlights two main results. First, the representations of stakeholders shed light on bordering dynamics that can be combined even though they can also appear to be contradictory. In particular, the paper unveils the dimension of ‘a-bordering’, which refers to a certain status quo of and about the border. Second, the representations of stakeholders show ambivalent and concomitant visions of a ‘cross-border integration with the border’ and a ‘cross-border integration without the border’. These representations challenge the implementation of cross-border policies and schemes.",Border;cross-border integration;cross-border metropolitan region;Eurometropolis Lille–Kortrijk–Tournai;representations,"Research Article"

Social cohesion is understood as a key element of societal stability, which is increasingly constrained in many urban contexts. Against the backdrop of decision-makers being challenged to find effective governance modes and policies addressing ever more diverse urban populations, the commentary presents evidence on how urban authorities use European funds in addressing social cohesion challenges. Cities’ use of the European Structural and Investment (ESI) Funds in diversity governance has been found to hinge on various factors that are often inter-institutionally determined and that may restrict cities’ possibilities to make most efficient use of the funding. The commentary concludes that more effective and participative forms of multi-level cooperation within frameworks like cohesion policy and the newly established Urban Agenda for the EU are necessary in supporting social cohesion and successful diversity governance in European cities. It further suggests that a reform of EU cohesion policy should entail both conceptual and institutional innovations, allowing for an integration of the intersections of urban diversity and cohesion in policy and fund design and a reinforcement of the partnership principle.",Cohesion policy;diversity;European Regional Development Fund;European Social Fund;European Structural and Investment Funds;social cohesion;structural funds;Urban Agenda for the EU,"Research Article"

Yet as research has progressed, it has become clear that experimentation is not a singular phenomenon that can be readily understood using any one conceptual entry point. In this paper, we focus on one particular mode of experimentation – the urban living laboratory (ULL) – and develop a typology through which to undertake a comparative analysis of 40 European ULLs, to understand how and why such forms of experimentation are being designed and implemented, and to identify the particular forms of experimentation they entail. We argue that there are distinct types of ULL taking shape, delimited by the ways in which they are designed and deployed through, on the one hand, specific kinds of configuration and practice and, on the other hand, by the ways in which they take laboratory form: the different dispositions towards the laboratory they entail. We propose three ‘ideal’ ULL types – strategic, civic and organic – and argue that these can be placed along the spectrum of four dispositions: trial, enclave, demonstration and platform.",Disposition;experimentation;governance;sustainability;urban living laboratory,"Research Article"

In fact, the ‘smart city’ has become a widely spread vision used by a variety of powerful key actors as well as a top-down urban political strategy that is applied in order to promote new arrangements, models and technologies for almost all policy areas. By using the Italian case as a point of reference, this paper analyses how smart city strategies are institutionalized and embedded in times of crisis on different spatial scales. Therefore, the paper adapts a strategic-relational approach that provides a conceptual framework for understanding the spatial dimension of smart city strategies. It argues that smart city strategies reflect a set of multiscalar political strategies leading to new responsibilities and powers on a local scale, as well as the creation of new state territoriality. Smart cities in Italy are part of metropolitan reforms that strengthen the role of large cities while reproducing existing territorial inequalities. Furthermore, they are used to create new public–private partnerships and new investment opportunities on different spatial scales. In addition, a content analysis of smart city rankings and reports sheds light on the modes of representation of smart city strategies, analysing them as elements of policymaking in times of crisis.",Crisis;Italy;multiscalarity;smart city;urban political strategies,"Research Article"

We examine how the four city authorities have actively collaborated to frame a disparate and uncoordinated set of information and communication technology-led initiatives, what Dourish terms the ‘accidental smart city’, into an articulated vision of Dublin as a smart city. In particular, we focus on the work of ‘Smart Dublin’, a shared unit established to coordinate, manage and promote Dublin’s smart city initiatives and to drive new economic development opportunities centred on corporate interventions into urban management and living. Our analysis highlights the value of undertaking a holistic mapping of a smart city in formation, and the role of political and administrative geographies and specialist smart city units in shaping that formation.",Governance;procurement by challenge;Small Business Innovation Research;scaling;smart city;Smart Dublin;strategy;test-bedding,"Research Article"

Firstly, capital cities are promoted as ‘national champions’ in the context of global territorial competition. Secondly, metropolitan regions are characterised by recurrent crises of ‘governability’ as economic, social, environmental and infrastructural interdependencies escape existing jurisdictional scales. However, this process is highly uneven, reflecting the ways in which cities are embedded in their national contexts. Drawing from the literature on varieties of capitalism, and in particular O’Riain’s perspective on the Irish case, we suggest that in an era when cities are claimed to be acting as ‘national champions’, territorial politics need to be more strongly foregrounded in these discussions. Through an in-depth qualitative case-study of Dublin (Ireland), we argue that while government power may be strongly centralised in the city of Dublin, the spatial entity of Dublin is relatively powerless. Despite a number of recommendations since the 1970s, there has been little will or action to meaningfully devolve power to the city-regional level in any way, contrary to comparative European experiences. The paper illustrates how a central state stranglehold over the Dublin metropolitan area is hampering the efficient governance and sustainable development of the city. These governance constraints at the sub-national level with significant planning implications indicate a reluctance to engage with the metropolitan as a particular territorial scale in Ireland – and a profound fixity in the architecture of the state.

Despite being launched with great fanfare as localised victories, City Deals raise important questions regarding the shape of the UK state system and the objectives of spatial policy.

In this paper, we study the transformation of urban governance in the Low Countries through city case studies of Apeldoorn (Netherlands) and Antwerp (Belgium). We show how Dutch urban governance is financialized by connecting local public finance with financialized real estate markets through municipal land banks. However, inter-municipal financial solidarity and ring-fencing municipalities from financial markets create specific continental European processes of financialization. Flemish municipalities, in contrast, have shifted from a model of laissez-faire urban development (embedded in a system of large municipal autonomy) towards entrepreneurial urban growth regimes, in which technocratic public and private actors have increased access to public financial resources, which are used to create large urban renewal projects. In Belgium, autonomous municipal real estate corporations are a crucial instrument for connecting municipal finance to the real estate market.",Entrepreneurialism;financialization;Flanders;the Netherlands;urban governance,"Research Article"

With this, we seek to contribute to the debate on how the role of the local state has changed from securing affordable housing for low-income households into becoming an essential player involved in real estate speculation. Taking Little Mountain in Vancouver as the first example, we examine the privatization and demolition of the public housing complex and thus the withdrawal of the state. Our second example, Ostend in Frankfurt, investigates the restructuring of a working-class neighbourhood through active state-led interventions including massive public investment. We analyse the two empirical examples along five dimensions: causal drivers and mechanisms that have led to the changing role of the state in governing urban transformations; policy instruments used by state agencies to encourage gentrification; strategies to legitimize state-led gentrification; outcomes in terms of direct and exclusionary displacement; and the forms of contestation and protest. We maintain that both cases, although presenting a stark contrast, follow the same rule, namely state-led gentrification.",Gentrification;housing;local state;social mixing;Vancouver;Frankfurt,"Research Article"

Applying this perspective, studies have insightfully shown how policymaking centred around smart cities is at once a messy, networked process stretching across scales, while also manifesting itself in concrete practices shaped by territorial–regulatory contexts. Informed by empirical research on smart city policies in Hungary and the Netherlands, this paper argues that the policy mobilities approach tends to overemphasize the global and the local. Notwithstanding the transnational circulation of smart city ideas, the national scale continues being reproduced by these ideas as a relevant scale of urban regulation, discursive framing and strategy-making under globalization. To acknowledge this, and to move towards a more decidedly multiscalar perspective on actually existing smart urbanisms, it is suggested that we incorporate the national scale, understood as a relational set of practices and discourses, more explicitly into our analysis. Insights from the Hungarian and Dutch case studies are used to illustrate the manifold ways in which the local embedding of the globally mobile smart city concept is shaped by the national scale, as well as how the national itself is being renegotiated in this process.",Multiscalar;national scale;policy mobilities;scale debate;smart city;urban policy,"Research Article"

Using an analytical framework based on three dimensions of Europeanization (direction, object and impact), we examine the extent to which urban policies are moving towards an integrated approach to sustainable urban development, as supported by the EU. The paper highlights the contradictions between processes of convergence through Europeanization, and path-dependent systems and trajectories that forge alternative paths. In doing so, it advances wider debates on the impact of Europeanization in a neo-liberal context by arguing that member states more likely to be affected by Europeanization are those most impacted by national austerity measures. A process of ‘variegated Europeanization’ is proposed to capture the differential practices taking place within the EU with regard to the circulation of the EU’s approach to urban policy.",Europeanization;urban policy;policy mobility;urban agenda;policy transfer,"Research Article"

The public sector constitutes one of the main categories of large landowners, although this type of ownership takes more than one form, due to the wide variety of public sector bodies holding property. Public land management became one of the focuses of austerity policies in many European countries after the burst of economic crisis in 2008–2009, externally imposed in those countries that went through bailout programmes. In Greece, the history of land policy shows that a fundamental objective of state policy was the distribution and liquidation of public land, a policy that contributed to the formation of an extensive system of small land ownership. From 2010 onwards, a plethora of formal legislation sought to accelerate development procedures for the remaining large-scale public property, as a background resource to attract large-scale, so-called “strategic”, investments. This paper explores the critical characteristics and outcomes of the reforms to transform public land policy, identifying the interactions with urban planning, before and during the economic crisis. Taking a longer temporal view, the paper highlights the entrenched relationships existing between public land policy, urban planning and property development processes and their significance in the diachronic continuities often concealed in major policy reversals and reforms. It argues that ultimately there is a lack of a coherent and sustainable public property valorisation policy, being deprived of any institutional innovation for new forms of urban development, as well as of social acceptance.",Economic crisis;Greece;large-scale property development;public land policy;urban planning,"Research Article"

Using register data on all families moving out from metropolitan areas in Sweden during the period 2003–2013, we found a small but steady outflow of families, mainly to medium-sized or small towns. The highly educated are overrepresented among these families, thus providing potential for an inflow of competence to the receiving areas. Contrary to expected, the assumed flexibility in time and space among knowledge sector professionals does not seem to enable them more than others to pursue counterurban moves. Instead, public sector professionals characterise families making a counterurban move to all destination regions, while men with a profession within arts and crafts to a higher extent move with their family to more rural areas.",Competing risk;counterurban migration;counterurbanisation;event-history analysis;families;profession,"Research Article"

The findings generally show that labour flows between manufacturing and services have important bi-directional features, even with manufacturing generally declining. There is no staff exodus from manufacturing to services, but rather an exchange suggesting skill interdependencies, especially between high-tech manufacturing and KIBS. However, there are strong geographical dimensions to this, emphasising a reinforcement of the spatial division of labour patterns. In trend terms, the decline of manufacturing is rather similar across all regional types; however, business services are growing much faster in metropolitan regions. The labour flow between manufacturing and KIBS is more likely in metropolitan regions, but far more often additionally involves geographical mobility, either between or towards the metropolitan regions. Thus, the major challenge facing less dense and peripheral regions is not necessarily the decline of manufacturing per se, but that (a) the low levels of transition into business services are insufficient to make up for employment losses in manufacturing and (b) the fact that there is considerable out-migration of experienced and skilled workers from manufacturing, who are joining the growing numbers of business services in metropolitan regions.",Economic geography;labour mobility;regional divergence;relatedness;sector integration,"Research Article"

The national governments in both Italy and the UK have constructed regulatory and governance relationships to orchestrate and reorder economic, social and ecological challenges and devolve responsibilities at the sub-national level. This has offered an opportunity for the peculiarities of regional setups to be taken into account and regions have contributed towards the promotion of green and sustainable path development via the route of promoting RE deployment. The paper argues that the downscaling and distribution of responsibility in the cases investigated reflect the capacity and willingness of nation states to respond to and mediate the strategic goals and outcomes formulated at national and international levels. Nevertheless, while the regions investigated display differences in their incentives, capacities and capabilities to increase RE deployment, their ability to act is very much influenced by nation states, stressing the important role of the state in mediating the form and direction of RE deployment.",Regions;renewable energy;state;Italian regions;Wales;Scotland;eco-restructuring,"Research Article"
