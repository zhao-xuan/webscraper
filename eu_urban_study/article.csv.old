The Re-Institution of Local Self-Government in Eastern Germany,David Sadler;;;;;Martin Osterland;;;;;Costis Hadjimichalis;;;;;Arne Isaksen;;;;;James Anderson;;;;;James Goodman;;;;;Roger Bivand;;;;;Rodney Wilson;;;;;Harvey W. Armstrong;;;;;Robert Read;;;;;Lila Leontidou;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;Abel Albet;;;;;Adam Swain;;;;;Maria Lucinda Fonseca;;;;;Richard Caddel;;;;;Julien Savary;;;;;Daniel Austin;;;;;Allan M. Williams;;;;;,1994,23,11,After unification the centralized political order of the former East Germany was replaced by a system which gave back the right of self-government to democrati cally elected local institutions. The re-establishment of local government and municipal administration has proved to be difficult, however. On the structural level, the new administrative order only partly fits the actual problems eastern German municipalities are faced with. In terms of personnel, new departmental heads and administrators do not have sufficient ex perience in administration or appropriate qualifi cations in legal matters.,,Other
The Fringes of Europe and EU Integration: A View From the South,David Sadler;;;;;Martin Osterland;;;;;Costis Hadjimichalis;;;;;Arne Isaksen;;;;;James Anderson;;;;;James Goodman;;;;;Roger Bivand;;;;;Rodney Wilson;;;;;Harvey W. Armstrong;;;;;Robert Read;;;;;Lila Leontidou;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;Abel Albet;;;;;Adam Swain;;;;;Maria Lucinda Fonseca;;;;;Richard Caddel;;;;;Julien Savary;;;;;Daniel Austin;;;;;Allan M. Williams;;;;;,1994,48,25,Regions and cities in southern Europe are facing major problems in the present phase of European inte gration. Current changes in their spatial division of labour seem not to have been adequately understood by national and EU policy-makers as both are preoc cupied with the 'gap approach' and a linear view of the development process. Furthermore, the Maas tricht Treaty itself pays little attention to non- economic, non-competition issues in general and to urban and regional issues in particular. Southern fringes struggled a century ago for their integration into their national states and economies. For various historical reasons this project remained unfinished until the 1960s and 1970s. Now they have to start their struggle again under conditions of a zero-sum game in a culturally unknown environment.,,Research Article
New Industrial Spaces and Industrial Districts in Norway: Productive Concepts in Explaining Regional Development?,David Sadler;;;;;Martin Osterland;;;;;Costis Hadjimichalis;;;;;Arne Isaksen;;;;;James Anderson;;;;;James Goodman;;;;;Roger Bivand;;;;;Rodney Wilson;;;;;Harvey W. Armstrong;;;;;Robert Read;;;;;Lila Leontidou;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;Abel Albet;;;;;Adam Swain;;;;;Maria Lucinda Fonseca;;;;;Richard Caddel;;;;;Julien Savary;;;;;Daniel Austin;;;;;Allan M. Williams;;;;;,1994,34,13,The article discusses whether the two distinctive con cepts of new industrial spaces and industrial districts are useful in explaining specific parts of regional indus trial development since about 1970. First, the two concepts are clarified and delimited, both in relation to each other and to some other closely linked con cepts. Second, the usefulness of the concepts is dis cussed with respect to three case studies. The cases are well-known industrial agglomerations (in the Norwegian context), with fairly numerous firms in the three flexible production sectors mentioned by Storper and Scott (1989). The two concepts can throw light on important aspects of development in these three examples. However, other elements can also be included in an interpretation of the cases.,,Research Article
European and Irish Integration: Contradictions of Regionalism and Nationalism,David Sadler;;;;;Martin Osterland;;;;;Costis Hadjimichalis;;;;;Arne Isaksen;;;;;James Anderson;;;;;James Goodman;;;;;Roger Bivand;;;;;Rodney Wilson;;;;;Harvey W. Armstrong;;;;;Robert Read;;;;;Lila Leontidou;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;Abel Albet;;;;;Adam Swain;;;;;Maria Lucinda Fonseca;;;;;Richard Caddel;;;;;Julien Savary;;;;;Daniel Austin;;;;;Allan M. Williams;;;;;,1994,21,6,The politics of substate regional development and the politics of nation-states and nationalisms are brought into heightened conflict and contradiction by the pro cesses of integration in the European Union. The con tradictions, however, are opening up new political opportunities at regional levels. This article explores relationships between regionalism and nationalism in the case of Ireland, and more particularly Northern Ireland. Because of the violent national conflict, and the highly centralized nature of the state both in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, some of the tensions at the heart of the European integration are exemplified particularly sharply. We explored these mainly through in-depth interviews with leaders from both sides of industry and the various political parties in Northern Ireland, and with politicians and civil servants in Brussels. We report on the ways in which the interrelationships between regional econ omic development and the national conflict are per ceived and argued, highlighting the different strategies adopted for reconciling regionalism and nationalism.,,Research Article

Winners and Losers: The New Map of Economic Inequality in the European Union,Mick Dunford;;;;;Peter Sjøholt;;;;;Neil Ravenscroft;;;;;Stephen Young;;;;;Neil Hood;;;;;Alan Wilson;;;;;Inga Lena Grønlund;;;;;Tatyana Nefedova;;;;;Vladimir Baláz;;;;;Stephen Fothergill;;;;;Tim Unwin;;;;;Eike Schamp;;;;;Rachel Macdonald;;;;;Markus Hesse;;;;;,1994,22,61,This article examines some of the main features and causes of the changing geography of inequality and unequal development in the European Union (EU). The main spatial inequalities in the EU and the wider Europe are outlined, as are some of the trends in regional inequality since the early 1960s and their relation to economic performance. Considerable emphasis is placed on evidence of the dysfunctionality of wide inequalities for economic development, and it is argued that a neo-liberal programme of market integration and an intensification of competition for investment creates a zero-sum gain in which the gains of the winners are often at the expense of the losers. An initial attempt is made to identify some of the winners and losers of the late 1970s and 1980s and to identify some of the factors that help explain why some regions were more successful than others.,,Research Article
The Role of Producer Services in Industrial and Regional Development: The Nordic Case,Mick Dunford;;;;;Peter Sjøholt;;;;;Neil Ravenscroft;;;;;Stephen Young;;;;;Neil Hood;;;;;Alan Wilson;;;;;Inga Lena Grønlund;;;;;Tatyana Nefedova;;;;;Vladimir Baláz;;;;;Stephen Fothergill;;;;;Tim Unwin;;;;;Eike Schamp;;;;;Rachel Macdonald;;;;;Markus Hesse;;;;;,1994,36,8,The principal focus of this article is producer-related services, their growing need in enterprises and the ways in which this need is being satisfied through different transactional forms (by being internalized or externalized). This leads to a discussion of whether the substantial services growth during the early and mid-1980s was genuine or merely reflected changes of transactional forms. Growth and its regional reper cussions are analysed by uncovering how the changes were a consequence of cyclical changes, new general conditions or frames of reference (deregulation), re structuring of enterprises and the role of financial operations and transactions. Changing trends and pat terns at the start of the 1990s are then examined in the light not only of recession but also of new possible structural readjustments in production systems, and the changing role of financial institutions. Regional impacts are examined by analyses of recent data, mainly from Norway but also from other Nordic countries.,,Research Article
Leisure Policy in the New Europe: The Uk Department of National Heritage as a Model of Development and Integration,Mick Dunford;;;;;Peter Sjøholt;;;;;Neil Ravenscroft;;;;;Stephen Young;;;;;Neil Hood;;;;;Alan Wilson;;;;;Inga Lena Grønlund;;;;;Tatyana Nefedova;;;;;Vladimir Baláz;;;;;Stephen Fothergill;;;;;Tim Unwin;;;;;Eike Schamp;;;;;Rachel Macdonald;;;;;Markus Hesse;;;;;,1994,48,2,Leisure is in the vanguard of a social and cultural revolution which is replacing the former east/west political bipolarity with a globalized economic system in which the new Europe has a central role. Within this revolution, leisure, including recreation, culture and tourism, is constructed as the epitome of success ful capitalist development, the very legitimation of the global transmogrification from a production to a con sumption orientation. While acting as a direct en couragement to the political transformation in many eastern European states, it is uncertain how the issue of leisure policy is being handled, given its centrality to the new economic order. This article therefore examines the experience of western Europe, con sidering in particular the degree to which the newly created Department of National Heritage in the UK provides a potential model for leisure development and policy integration in the new Europe. Despite an official rhetoric of support and promotion of leisure activities, reflecting the growing economic significance of tourism and the positive relationship between leisure provision and regional economic development, the article establishes that in the place of the tra ditional role of the state in promoting leisure interests, the introduction of the department has sig nified a shift to the use of leisure to promote the government's interests, particularly in regenerating citizen rights claims towards the market. While an institution such as the Department of National Heri tage may have relevance to emerging states as an element in the maintenance of political hegemony, therefore, it is questionable how far it can be viewed as a promoter or protector of leisure as a signifier of a newly won political, economic and cultural freedom throughout Europe.,,Research Article
Targeting Policy as a Competitive Strategy for European Inward Investment Agencies,Mick Dunford;;;;;Peter Sjøholt;;;;;Neil Ravenscroft;;;;;Stephen Young;;;;;Neil Hood;;;;;Alan Wilson;;;;;Inga Lena Grønlund;;;;;Tatyana Nefedova;;;;;Vladimir Baláz;;;;;Stephen Fothergill;;;;;Tim Unwin;;;;;Eike Schamp;;;;;Rachel Macdonald;;;;;Markus Hesse;;;;;,1994,38,42,This article provides a framework to assist the target ing activities of European inward investment agencies (IIAs), recognizing that historically inward investment has not fulfilled the desired role of facilitating self- sustaining and innovative economic development in many European regions. While many such agencies do target their promotional programmes, the variables utilized in defining target markets have been in sufficiently directed to the real issues in economic development. Using techniques applied in industrial products' marketing, a new approach is presented, which relates the desired outputs from inward invest ment (based on a segment's level of economic impact indicators and their weighted importance) to the competitive advantages of countries and regions (based on the country's strengths and weaknesses relative to each segment's requirements). In this model, the economic impact indicators go well beyond simply employment creation to consider other employment indicators as well as trade and balance of payments and technology transfer indi cators which are critical to economic development. A matrix of appropriateness is developed which identi fies the segments that should be targeted by the par ticufar IIA based on the attractiveness of the segment and country competitive advantages. Operational considerations are reviewed and policy implications discussed.,,Research Article

The Rise of International Co-Operation in the European Automobile Industry: the Renault Case,Jim Lewis;;;;;Julien Savary;;;;;Russell King;;;;;Ian Shuttleworth;;;;;Pertti Koistinen;;;;;Brian Ilbery;;;;;David Clark;;;;;Nigel Berkeley;;;;;Ian Goldman;;;;;Manuel Villaverde Cabral;;;;;Mark Blacksell;;;;;Peter Gripaios;;;;;Manuel Valenzuela;;;;;Judith Moreno;;;;;Zoltan Raffay;;;;;Diane Perrons;;;;;Jeff Blackford;;;;;Michael Keating;;;;;Linda McDowell;;;;;Richard Black;;;;;,1995,31,2,This article first analyses international strategies of European automobile manufacturers. Through a description of their corporate development since the early 1970s it shows that these groups, which still remain mainly European and non-globalized, have developed numerous specialized alliances, but have also used mergers and acquisitions as a way of enlarging their corporate size and their geographic scope. The major conclusion is to predict more international mergers between European groups in the future. As the international crisis in the sector continues, and as international competition increases within their formerly protected markets, these groups will have to join forces through close co-operation and merger. The second part of the article develops the case of Renault's international strategy. It analyses how this group improved the competitiveness of all its European operations, but failed in the USA and still remains today relatively under-internationalized. The agreement signed in 1990 with Volvo is then described as a highly complex strategic alliance which had to move towards a merger, finally decided at the end of 1993. This merger process failed mainly because nationalist barriers exist to international co-operation in the automobile industry. The recent take-over of Rover by BMW, however, shows that merger remains an appropriate strategic answer.,,Research Article
The Emigration and Employment of Irish Graduates: The Export of High-Quality Labour From the Periphery of Europe,Jim Lewis;;;;;Julien Savary;;;;;Russell King;;;;;Ian Shuttleworth;;;;;Pertti Koistinen;;;;;Brian Ilbery;;;;;David Clark;;;;;Nigel Berkeley;;;;;Ian Goldman;;;;;Manuel Villaverde Cabral;;;;;Mark Blacksell;;;;;Peter Gripaios;;;;;Manuel Valenzuela;;;;;Judith Moreno;;;;;Zoltan Raffay;;;;;Diane Perrons;;;;;Jeff Blackford;;;;;Michael Keating;;;;;Linda McDowell;;;;;Richard Black;;;;;,1995,48,22,During the late 1980s, emigration of university graduates from the Republic of Ireland rose to unprecedented levels. More than one-quarter of the graduates were living abroad nine months after graduation, according to statistics issued by the Higher Education Authority. After reviewing the changing socio-economic background to Irish emigration since the early 1950s, the second, and major, part of the article will present the findings of a large-scale empirical investigation of the employment and migration histories of a sample of 383 graduates who left Irish universities in the mid-1980s. This survey was carried out in 1990 and so recorded approximately five years of occupational and spatial mobility for each respondent. Although the survey results do back up popular impressions of an Irish brain drain, in many respects Irish high-skilled migration is merely a subset of total Irish migration since the graduates were found to rely on traditional family and ethnic networks in choosing their destination and often their employment. The destination countries of Irish graduate emigrants closely reflected the destinations of Irish emigrants as a whole, except that graduates showed a higher propensity to migrate to continental European countries. Moreover, a lot of to-and-fro movement was discovered, indicating that Irish graduates are highly mobile and responsive to opportunities at home and abroad. Finally the theoretical and policy implications of the research are evaluated. Conceptually the Irish brain drain can be contextualized within centre-periphery theory and the notion of Ireland having a truncated labour market: in other words, as a small-scale, geographically peripheral, unindustrialized and ex-colonial economy, Ireland cannot provide sufficient challenging jobs for its graduate population, which is itself increasing. Policy-wise, educating young people for export may be hard to justify, particularly when this investment in human capital is exported to richer countries like the United States, Britain and Germany.,,Research Article
The Search for National Employment Policies in Central and Eastern Europe,Jim Lewis;;;;;Julien Savary;;;;;Russell King;;;;;Ian Shuttleworth;;;;;Pertti Koistinen;;;;;Brian Ilbery;;;;;David Clark;;;;;Nigel Berkeley;;;;;Ian Goldman;;;;;Manuel Villaverde Cabral;;;;;Mark Blacksell;;;;;Peter Gripaios;;;;;Manuel Valenzuela;;;;;Judith Moreno;;;;;Zoltan Raffay;;;;;Diane Perrons;;;;;Jeff Blackford;;;;;Michael Keating;;;;;Linda McDowell;;;;;Richard Black;;;;;,1995,40,0,The nation-state is not dead and its raison d'être is far from over. On the contrary, the nation-state is searching for a new structure and is playing a crucial role in the transformation and modernization process. The examples of countries from central and eastern Europe demonstrate the importance of nation-state formation as a mediating factor during the current spate of economic and sacial changes. It provides the focal point for interest groups in society and more generally for external relations in the evolving global system of world capitalism. A problem in social science today is that there is too little critical research into how the nation-state and the capitalist market economy are interlinked, and how the former shapes the formation of welfare systems, labour institutions and labour market policies. Using the case study examples of Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and to some extent the former GDR, the concept of a national solution to the transform. ation process will be examined in each country with respect to the search for an employment policy.,,Research Article
Telematics and Rural Development: Evidence From a Survey of Small Businesses in the European Union,Jim Lewis;;;;;Julien Savary;;;;;Russell King;;;;;Ian Shuttleworth;;;;;Pertti Koistinen;;;;;Brian Ilbery;;;;;David Clark;;;;;Nigel Berkeley;;;;;Ian Goldman;;;;;Manuel Villaverde Cabral;;;;;Mark Blacksell;;;;;Peter Gripaios;;;;;Manuel Valenzuela;;;;;Judith Moreno;;;;;Zoltan Raffay;;;;;Diane Perrons;;;;;Jeff Blackford;;;;;Michael Keating;;;;;Linda McDowell;;;;;Richard Black;;;;;,1995,25,16,Indigenous rural development in the peripheral regions of Europe could be encouraged through the uptake of telematics by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, little is known about patterns of and resistances towards the adoption of telematics in rural areas and there exists a view that the main beneficiaries will be larger businesses in core areas of economic activity. After a brief exploration of the relationships between telematics and rural development, this article reports the early findings of a research project on the use of, and attitudes towards, telematics among SMEs in seven rural regions of the European Union. Results indicate that the predominantly very small, independent and privately owned businesses make very limited use of telematics services, mainly because of a lack of awareness and inadequate training. The main business problems faced by these businesses — cashflow, marketing, lack of qualified staff, and information technology support- present opportunities for telematics in rural areas. Yet successful adoption of telematics applications will occur only if they are sympathetic to the needs of small rural businesses. The article concludes by suggesting some ways in which the benefits of telematics can favour peripheral rural areas as well as urban core areas.,,Research Article

Metropolitan Polarization, the North-South Divide and Socio-Spatial Inequality in Britain: A Long-Term Perspective,Costis Hadjimichalis;;;;;Diane Perrons;;;;;Enzo Mingione;;;;;Mick Dunford;;;;;Ash Amin;;;;;John Tomaney;;;;;Susan Buckingham-Hatfield;;;;;,1995,34,14,Spatial inequalities have been a constant feature of capitalist development in Britain. Today there are two major macro-geographical divides. The first is between the Greater London metropolitan area and the rest of Britain. The second is a related division between North and South which assumed particular prominence after the inter-war depression when the industries of the old industrial heartland went into decline. Attention is paid first to a variety of social, economic and political indicators of these persistent divisions and of the more complex mosaic of in equality that underlies them. An attempt will be made to explain the evolution of these divisions via refer ence to some of the underlying structures specific to British capitalism, the deep-seated process of relative economic decline that dates from the late nineteenth century, the dynamics of the post-war boom and the impact of the neo-liberal, two-nations accumulation strategy of the Thatcher era which saw a regionally differentiated process of de-industrialization in 1979- 83 followed by a speculative, service industry-led boom and a service-led recession after 1989. To con clude I shall try to identify the relationships between inequality and economic dynamism, focusing in par ticular on the contradictory character of inequality.,,Research Article
The Regional Dilemma in a Neo-Liberal Europe,Costis Hadjimichalis;;;;;Diane Perrons;;;;;Enzo Mingione;;;;;Mick Dunford;;;;;Ash Amin;;;;;John Tomaney;;;;;Susan Buckingham-Hatfield;;;;;,1995,83,38,It has recently been argued that the consolidation of a globally integrated economy restricts the ability of governments to intervene effectively in the develop ment of their national economies. As a result, nation states are said to be transferring their power both upwards to supra-national institutions (such as the European Union) and downwards by conceding power to regional governments. Within the EU, the concept of a 'Europe of Regions', representing an emerging division of responsibilities between Union- level authorities and regional institutions, is thus seen by some as a corollary of moves towards economic and monetary union, as the role of the nation state wanes. In this paper we question whether such a 'Europe of Regions' is in fact emerging, and whether it is likely to be to the advantage of the less favoured regions. We point to the enduring importance of the nation state as an arena for economic policy formu lation, and explore what might be the content of a new national approach to regional economic policy.,,Research Article

This article considers three main lines of analysis which have emerged. These concentrate respectively on insti tutions, industrial organization and transactions, and technological change and learning. Each has made strong claims about the role of the region. I argue here, however, that none has yet developed a wholly convincing explanation for the resurgence of regional economies. To do this it is necessary to understand the region as a locus of untraded interdependencies. This has implications for how we think about regional and industrial policies. I illustrate these points with some remarks on regional policies in contemporary Europe.,,Research Article

Its substantive focus is on the developments that are potentially transforming Istanbul into a global metrop olis. We consider the attempts being made by the urban elites to modernize the urban structure and form, in line with economic strategies taking place in other world cities. The article then moves on to consider the urban culture of Istanbul, looking at de velopments which problematize and inhibit economic globalization. These developments reflect the resur gence of elements that have been repressed in Tur kish culture during the Republican period (when Istanbul was displaced by Ankara as the national capi tal). What we now see is the coexistence of two Istanbuls: that being engineered from above by the urban elites; and that which is rising from below as a result of the new cultural dynamics. We argue that Istanbul provides an excellent focus for exploring the relation between economic and cultural, and also political, aspects of globalization, showing how the processes of urban change are rooted in the broader socio-economic agendas of the particular global region.,,Research Article

Lobbying 'Brussels': The Case of Scotland Europa,James Mitchell;;;;;Peter Daniels;;;;;Justin Greenwood;;;;;Roger Levy;;;;;Rachel Stewart;;;;;John Bachtler;;;;;John Pløger;;;;;Richard Caddel;;;;;Vladimír Baláz;;;;;Andrew Cumbers;;;;;John Tuppen;;;;;Emanuel de Kadt;;;;;Jacquelin Burgess;;;;;Russell King;;;;;Steven Pinch;;;;;Andrew Gilg;;;;;,1995,21,14,The increase in paradiplomacy the activities of regions below the level of the state in international politics particularly in matters of trade and economic affairs - has been noted by scholars of federal states. This paper draws on this literature to consider the background and debates within the United Kingdom, one of the most centralized states in the European Union, on the setting up of Scotland Europa, a Scot tish lobbying office in Brussels in May 1992. The resurgence of political nationalism in Scotland in the late 1980s coincided with the 'relaunch' of Europe, with the Single European Act and the single European Market providing significant backdrops. Government fears that such an office might be used by its oppo nents to articulate alternative views were voiced in leaked memoranda and these provide important insights into its thinking. In essence, the issue of 'Who speaks for Scotland?' lay at the heart of debates on the nature and functions of the Brussels office. Europe was offering a new battleground in an old war. In particular, difficulties existed between the Scottish Office, representing central government, and the Scottish local authorities. These were ultimately resolved largely due to the skills of the first chief executive of the lobbying office. To date, a limited role has been cut out for Scotland Europa. Conse quently, the fears that paradiplomacy might become protodiplomacy- whereby the international activities of regions no longer parallel those of their central governments but act against them and threaten the integrity of the state - have proved unfounded.,,Research Article
The Eu Internal Market Programme and the Spatial Development of Producer Services in Great Britain,James Mitchell;;;;;Peter Daniels;;;;;Justin Greenwood;;;;;Roger Levy;;;;;Rachel Stewart;;;;;John Bachtler;;;;;John Pløger;;;;;Richard Caddel;;;;;Vladimír Baláz;;;;;Andrew Cumbers;;;;;John Tuppen;;;;;Emanuel de Kadt;;;;;Jacquelin Burgess;;;;;Russell King;;;;;Steven Pinch;;;;;Andrew Gilg;;;;;,1995,70,6,Until recently national markets for services have been sheltered from competition. The EU internal market programme provides an opportunity to reduce service market fragmentation and make European services as a whole more competitive in world markets. Successful implementation of the pro gramme may be accompanied by some relocation of producer services within the Union. A recent study suggests that this would not raise undue concern among the member states, In this paper it is suggested that there is a potential conflict between evidence for a wider dispersal of producer services within the British space economy (and the benefits that it rep resents for the process of regional economic restruc turing) and any centralization tendencies in relation to a European-wide market. This will reassert the hegemony of London and the South East which will ensure that Britain capitalizes upon the EU internal market programme but at the expense of a continuing improvement in the range and quality of producer services in the provincial cities and regions.,,Research Article
The European Union Structural Fund Allocations: 'Lobbying To Win' or Recycling the Budget?,James Mitchell;;;;;Peter Daniels;;;;;Justin Greenwood;;;;;Roger Levy;;;;;Rachel Stewart;;;;;John Bachtler;;;;;John Pløger;;;;;Richard Caddel;;;;;Vladimír Baláz;;;;;Andrew Cumbers;;;;;John Tuppen;;;;;Emanuel de Kadt;;;;;Jacquelin Burgess;;;;;Russell King;;;;;Steven Pinch;;;;;Andrew Gilg;;;;;,1995,33,10,The growth of European Union territorial policy competencies has brought with it significant budget ary changes and heralded ambitions of a 'Europe of the Regions'. Regional policy funding now commands around 30 per cent of all European Union expendi ture. In the recent (1994-99) round of structural fund allocations there were more 'winners' than 'losers'. Over 60 per cent of the European territory is now covered by the funds. A number of local authori ties, justifiably pleased with the award of funds to their territories, are full of 'campaign lessons' of 'successful lobbying in Brussels'. Yet structural fund application procedures dictate that individual regions cannot enter into negotiations with the EU to obtain funds; rather, they can only seek to influence member states, the 'gatekeepers' for applications made to the EU for structural funding. The real 'winners' of struc tural fund awards are the member states themselves. This is because the spending of structural funds is diffcult to audit with any certainty, enabling member states to use European money as substitute territorial funding, rather than meeting EU rules designed to ensure that European funds are additional to national spending on the regions. Detailed insights are pro vided into the processes of applying for, spending, and auditing EU structural funds, demonstrating how it is possible for member states to draw benefit for central government spending programmes from funds intended for territorial initiatives. Rather than a 'Eur ope of the Regions' it would appear that EU spending can be recycled back to national governments, reinforcing centralization rather than creating decen tralization. The absence of strong regional 'policy net works' of public and private players in centralized unitary member states to monitor additionality exacerbates the problem. Case study material from Grampian, Scotland, is presented to illustrate these processes.,,Research Article

Crisis in German Decentralized Production: Unexpected Rigidity and the Challenge of an Alternative Form of Flexible Organization in Baden Württemberg,Elizabeth Strom;;;;;Howard Green;;;;;Philip Booth;;;;;Gary Herrigel;;;;;Frank Peck;;;;;Ian Stone;;;;;Marisol Esteban;;;;;Jesús del Río Luelmo;;;;;Tom Gallagher;;;;;Bodo Freund;;;;;Jorge Gaspar;;;;;David Sadler;;;;;Sally Hayward;;;;;Judit Timár;;;;;Heinz Heineberg;;;;;Jan van Weesep;;;;;Dick Lawless;;;;;Marta Bruno;;;;;James Barlow;;;;;,1996,61,29,This paper discusses the current crisis in the German industrial district of Baden Württemberg. Considered to be a flagship example of flexibility and international competitiveness for European manufacturing during the 1980s, producers in the district - both large and small - have fallen upon hard times in the 1990s. This paper suggests that the explanation for the crisis can not be traced either to high wages or low levels of productivity in the region. Rather, the problem con fronting the producers in Baden Württemberg- and by extension in German industry as a whole - is that they are being challenged by an alternative system of flexible manufacturing that is superior to their own. Rigidity in the system of production in Germany can be traced to institutional arrangements that were previously thought to be a source of strength: broad yet nonetheless specific skill categories and distinct, functional divisions within management. Successful adjustment in Germany today will have to involve profound self-reflection on and debate about the reform of some of the most taken-for-granted dimen sions of German industrial order.,,Research Article
Technology Parks and Regional Development in the Southern European Periphery: The Andalucia Case,Elizabeth Strom;;;;;Howard Green;;;;;Philip Booth;;;;;Gary Herrigel;;;;;Frank Peck;;;;;Ian Stone;;;;;Marisol Esteban;;;;;Jesús del Río Luelmo;;;;;Tom Gallagher;;;;;Bodo Freund;;;;;Jorge Gaspar;;;;;David Sadler;;;;;Sally Hayward;;;;;Judit Timár;;;;;Heinz Heineberg;;;;;Jan van Weesep;;;;;Dick Lawless;;;;;Marta Bruno;;;;;James Barlow;;;;;,1996,42,3,Technology parks have been widely embraced as a mechanism for creating local high-technology com plexes in the context of regional development policy. Such policies are constructed on the basis that the creation of an appropriate infrastructure can induce cumulative development of technologically-related activities. In theory it is expected that the growth process will be characterized by a high degree of innovation, the application of locally-generated knowledge, flexible forms of organization and inter dependence between enterprises. Previous research has shown that there is considerable variability in the forms of development which occur on technology parks, and a debate has developed concerning the potential for the decentralization of high technology industry to peripheral locations. While many tech nology parks may not attain the ideal in terms of technological synergies, they can nonetheless produce significant regional development outcomes. This is demonstrated through a case study of the Andalucia Technology Park situated on the outskirts of the City of Milaga in the south of Spain. In this case, the high technology label has plainly acted as a magnet for public sector funding, which has been used to create the kind of modern customized infra structure demanded by inward investors. The initial 'cost-per-job' has undoubtedly been high, but the availability of financial support from the public sector suggests that expansions of existing projects and further inward investment are likely to occur. This interpretation of technology parks has important implications for our understanding of regional policy in the 1990s. Many technology parks, in reality, are used to produce what can be regarded as less ambitious but significant regional policy outcomes (i.e. job-creation through relocation and inward investment) and are perhaps more appropriately judged in those terms.,,Research Article

Blotevogel;;;;;Russell King;;;;;Antoine Bailly;;;;;Chris Jensen-Butler;;;;;Lila Leontidou;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;Tom Gallagher;;;;;Mike Crang;;;;;Peter Jackson;;;;;Mark Blacksell;;;;;Roger Bivand;;;;;R.E.H. Mellor;;;;;Adam Swain;;;;;Eleanore Kofman;;;;;,1996,71,12,This paper seeks to comprehend the nature of the relationship between economic restructuring and various processes of demographic change in Europe. The analysis reveals a broad set of complex inter relations between the economic and population systems. Population cannot be taken as a single de pendent variable acting in response to economic change. Demographic processes such as ageing and fertility decline can also act as independent variables providing feedback and input into socio-economic restructuring, and they can also be regarded as a kind of background system, reacting rather inertly compared to the short-term cycles and transform ations in the economy. Therefore demographic changes are often underestimated in their medium and long-term feedback effects. The labour market is taken as the main field of interplay between the sys tems of economy and population and thus this paper takes a close look at some important changes within the European labour market and submarkets. Changing employment conditions - the growth of the secondary labour market, the flexibilization of labour demand and increasingly also of supply, grow ing female labour force participation rates, generally high ethnic minority unemployment - reflect differ ent aspects of the transition from the Fordist to the postFordist regime as well as changing demographic and life-style influences. Together they have deeply transformed the European landscape of employment and unemployment The specific role of international migration is also analysed and it is seen to have fun damentally altered between the Fordist and postFordist eras. Less clear to interpret are changing internal migration patterns: has counterur banization stopped in response to restructuring and integration and is a new postFordist population map unfolding? The paper concludes by evaluating the nature of the relationship between economic restructuring and population trends and identifying pointers for future research.,,Research Article

After a conceptual framework emphasizing the impact of environmental factors has been presented, moves towards the creation of a federal state are reviewed and the structure of tourism in Belgium outlined. The evolution of the tourist organization network is then examined and the impact of communitization and regionalization is assessed, along with recent attempts to adopt a more product-oriented marketing approach. Among the changes observed are a decapitation of the network, delays in the development of a marketing emphasis, presentation of new and different geographies of Belgium and new configurations of tourist space.,,Research Article
Agri-Environmental Schemes in Switzerland: Euro-(in)Compatible?,Douglas G. Pearce;;;;;Geoff A.

It compares Swiss schemes with agri-environmental schemes in the EU (specifically the ESA and MEKA schemes) and hypothesizes what effects possible Swiss EU membership might have for the structure of its agri-environmental schemes and its landholders. Davos has been selected as a case-study to illustrate problems and opportunities of agri-environmental schemes in upland areas, and to provide a baseline for comparison in a European context. Swiss agri-environmental policies show great similarities with those of the EU and, under current conditions, Swiss EU membership would not have a great impact. The on-going debate about Euro-compatibility in Switzerland has led to a fruitful discussion and questioning of internal decision-making processes, but the EU can also learn from the Swiss experience, in particular with respect to Swiss targeting policies. Swiss integration into the EU would reinforce the already existing trend towards renunciation of an essentially productivist farming ethos in an economic environment still largely free from the problems of agricultural overproduction. It would also further encourage farmers to adopt farming practices that are more in line with EU post-productivist strategies of reduced agrarian production, while at the same time still maintaining the strong Swiss emphasis on environmental protection.,,Research Article

To a large extent Wales' economic transformation in recent years has been enabled and supported by regional aid funding at UK and European levels. The run-down of regional support may have major implications for Wales' attractiveness to mobile international investment, which is itself changing in volume and nature, as well as the promotion of indigenous firm growth. These concerns together with local difficulties affecting the role of the development agencies cast doubt on the economy's capability for maintaining progress.,,Research Article

The analysis considers a striking rhetorical shift in Italian discourses; if, initially, the Albanians were depicted in this crisis as 'Adriatic brothers' and 'noble savages' who vafidated the ideal of western democracy against Communism, over the course of the crisis they became increasingly represented as merely savage and 'non-European'. This shift was paralleled in the problem of defining the Albanians as 'political refugees' or 'economic migrants', the latter designation aligning them with immigrants from developing countries whose presence has increasingly been a site of tension in Italy, as in many other western European countries. Additionally, the article considers the self reflection stimulated in Italy in the wake of the Albanian Crisis, which in many respects problematized ltaly's own rightful position alongside other European nations. The research is based on Italian mass-media discourses and anthropological fieldwork conducted in southern Italy, in an area which housed most of the arrivals.,,Research Article

National governments and history strongly influence the present political power of the regions of Europe and thus the environment of firms. In West Germany the relative autonomy of Länder gave them opportunities to implement their own technology policy at the end of the 1970s. Focusing on regional technology policies in one old Land, Baden-Württemberg, and one new Land, Thuringia, in Germany in the mid-1990s, three main questions are asked in this article. First, what are the objectives, actors, instruments and strategies of regional technology policies in Baden-Württemberg and Thuringia and how much political autonomy do these Länder have to devise their own policies? Secondly, what are the effects of regional technology policies in Baden-Württemberg and Thuringia on regional economic development? Thirdly, to what extent do regional technology policies in Baden-Württemberg and Thuringia tackle specific regional economic problems ? The main conclusion is that both in Baden-Württemberg, a Land with a long tradition in technology policy and large economic problems, and in Thuringia, a new Land with an economy which suffered heavily from restructuring, regional technology policies have limited impacts on regional economies in transition.,,Research Article
New Spatial Configurations in the European Automobile Industry,Allan M.

Mack;;;;;David S. Jacobson;;;;;Lila Leontidou;;;;;Benito Giordano;;;;;Rob Imrie;;;;;Neil Coe;;;;;Jane Pollard;;;;;,1996,29,30,Based on a forecasting study of the geography of the European automobile industry, this paper analyses first its spatial hierarchy corresponding to a regional vertical division of labour within different countries in a centre-periphery framework. Central functions (marketing, planning, R & D, luxury and upper range car assembly, etc.) located in the 'Banane Bleue', are attracted by the centre of gravity in southern Germany, whereas peripheral functions (assembly of small cars, production of generic components) are decentralized to southern European countries, and now eastern countries. Secondly, the paper identifies factors governing its evolution: changes in production organization (technological innovation, lean production) and their impacts on the location of activities (through a desegregated approach to location constraints on different activities: assembly, manufacturing, generic and specific components, etc.), as well as the new competitive context on the European market (arrival of new competitors, reduction of overcapacity, new niches, etc.). Thirdly, a sketch of the spatial configuration of the European automobile industry in 2005 is proposed on the basis of two opposite modalities of complementary spatial dynamics: on one side, concentration versus decentralization of assembly plants; on the other side, polarization or dispersion of upstream activities. Their intersection leads to four possible scenario-configurations: agglomerated unipolar, dispersed unipolar, multipolar and continental integration. Finally, conditions which would encourage or, alternatively, impede each scenario are discussed.,,Research Article

Mack;;;;;David S. Jacobson;;;;;Lila Leontidou;;;;;Benito Giordano;;;;;Rob Imrie;;;;;Neil Coe;;;;;Jane Pollard;;;;;,1996,49,12,This paper deals with one particular representation of the increasing interest in regional issues in contemporary Europe: the proliferation of academic studies and consultancy reports aiming to assess the attractiveness and competitiveness of cities and regions. At the heart of the paper is a review of a number of such studies. Some of them set out to identify the 'hottest' regions for investors, often presenting their results in various forms of rankings or league tables. Others try to identify systemic transformation in the overall patterns of urban and regional change in Europe. Most studies, however, regardless of whether they see regional development as primarily driven by endogenous or exogenous processes, focus on the regions' set of factor endowments : the more richly endowed a region is, the greater is its chance to prosper in a situation where regions are seen to be engaged in a European - or even global - competition over development opportunities. In the latter part of the paper, we challenge this view. With reference to current research on industrial dynamics, we argue that sustainable regional strength is built on a continuously upgraded knowledge base, rather than on general factor endowments. Furthermore, we question the validity of the metaphor according to which regions compete with each other to develop.,,Research Article

Towards an Integrated Automotive Industry in Europe: A'Merging Filiere' Perspective,Arnoud Lagendijk;;;;;Reiner Martin;;;;;Mathias Schulze Steinen;;;;;Anna Bull;;;;;Susan Milner;;;;;Adrian Smith;;;;;Dimitri Economou;;;;;Wisla Surazska;;;;;Roger Bivand;;;;;Russell King;;;;;Pertti Koistinen;;;;;Mark Wise;;;;;Philip Crang;;;;;Stephen Syrett;;;;;Leigh Sparks;;;;,1997,51,32,Economic integration and technological developments are offering new opportunities for the automotive industry in Europe. Understanding and grasping such opportunities is crucial for improving Europe's competitive position in the global car market. This article explores this issue by embarking on a historical analysis of the European automotive production system applying the filiere concept. In doing so, the analysis focuses on internal relationships within the production chain as well as on the sociopolitical embedding of production. The main argument put forward is that enhanced innovative capabilities and competitive performance require more than the implementation of lean strategies within the existing business structure. Despite the intensive restructuring undertaken over the last decade, it seems that the industry is not fully exploiting the opportunities offered by market integration in Europe. This stagnation is attributed primarily to the vested interests of the major carmakers in retaining the present organizational structure and their political influence. The article develops a 'merging filiere' perspective which involves, besides genuine internationalization at various stages of the production chain, a more substantial shift in the responsibilities for design and production from carmakers to main suppliers and a certain detachment of producers from their home environment. The last section of the article focuses on the role of European policy. It is argued that the European Commission should set more distance between itself and the large carmakers and adopt a more favourable attitude towards the independent component industries.,,Research Article
State Aid, Regional Policy and Locational Competition in the European Union,Arnoud Lagendijk;;;;;Reiner Martin;;;;;Mathias Schulze Steinen;;;;;Anna Bull;;;;;Susan Milner;;;;;Adrian Smith;;;;;Dimitri Economou;;;;;Wisla Surazska;;;;;Roger Bivand;;;;;Russell King;;;;;Pertti Koistinen;;;;;Mark Wise;;;;;Philip Crang;;;;;Stephen Syrett;;;;;Leigh Sparks;;;;;Costis Hadjimichalis;;;;;,1997,26,13,In this article we show that there are inconsistencies between European regional policy and national state-aid policies. Arguing within a locational competition framework, we differentiate between the macro and the micro-level. On the macro-level, encompassing for example infrastructure and education, the European periphery is clearly disadvantaged vis-a-vis the core member states. On the micro-level, focusing on direct support to the productive sector, European state-aid regulations establish a hierarchy. According to Article 92 of the EC Treaty, least-favoured regions and regions in industrial decline are allowed to use region-specific state aid in order to attract mobile factors of production. All other regions are only allowed to use horizontal state aid. In the empirical analysis we show, however, that this privilege is not reflected in higher state-aid expenditure levels of the periphery vis-a-vis the core. This is mainly due to the limited budgetary possibilities of the peripheral member states. The present spatial pattern of expenditures reduces the prospects for cohesion and the efficiency of regional policy, and it leads to a waste of resources. The aggregate amount of state aid in Europe, as well as the market distortions induced by this state aid, is unnecessarily inflated. We therefore argue in favour of a tightening of state-aid regulations for the core countries and suggest a further concentration of EU resources in the periphery.,,Research Article
Local Identities and Territorial Politics in Italy and France,Arnoud Lagendijk;;;;;Reiner Martin;;;;;Mathias Schulze Steinen;;;;;Anna Bull;;;;;Susan Milner;;;;;Adrian Smith;;;;;Dimitri Economou;;;;;Wisla Surazska;;;;;Roger Bivand;;;;;Russell King;;;;;Pertti Koistinen;;;;;Mark Wise;;;;;Philip Crang;;;;;Stephen Syrett;;;;;Leigh Sparks;;;;;Costis Hadjimichalis;;;;;,1997,33,1,This article compares two areas, Sesto San Giovanni near Milan and V6nissieux near Lyon, which until recently were characterized by a working-class culture and a communist identity, which in turn stemmed from a concentration of large-scale heavy industry and the presence of powerful trade unions. Both areas have gone through a process of severe de-in-dustrialization and deep social change, accompanied by significant political developments. The article examines the effects these changes have had upon the two localities, both from the point of view of social identities and of the role and orientations of local political actors. Research findings in both towns indicate that there is a congruence between underlying social identities and the specific solutions attempted by the main political actors to deal with de-industrialization. In Sesto, the Communist Party and the left-dominated council have reacted to a weakening of the communist subculture by shedding their traditional proletarian image. They are keen to promote the development of small-scale industry, relying on the resilience and vitality of the family and social networks. In Venissieux the social situation is closer to 'anomie', while the left subculture is closing ranks and adopting a defensive stance. The local council relies on central government for large-scale schemes of urban regeneration. Nation-specific patterns of political behaviour and socioeconomic development prevail over crossnational similarities. A common phase as urban conurbations dominated by a small number of large corporations and as centres of trade-union militancy and communist culture has given way to contrasting scenarios.,,Research Article
Constructing Capitalism?: Small and Medium Enterprises, Industrial Districts and Regional Policy in Slovakia,Arnoud Lagendijk;;;;;Reiner Martin;;;;;Mathias Schulze Steinen;;;;;Anna Bull;;;;;Susan Milner;;;;;Adrian Smith;;;;;Dimitri Economou;;;;;Wisla Surazska;;;;;Roger Bivand;;;;;Russell King;;;;;Pertti Koistinen;;;;;Mark Wise;;;;;Philip Crang;;;;;Stephen Syrett;;;;;Leigh Sparks;;;;;Costis Hadjimichalis;;;;;,1997,71,13,This article examines the process of SME development and regional development in the context of Slovakia. It argues that SME development is not resulting in capitalist development which mirrors that of the industrial district model. The argument is developed through considering the concrete experience of SME development and institutional innovation in two regions in central Slovakia, partly drawing upon the results of a survey of SMEs in the manufacturing sector. I argue that there has only been a limited development of SMEs and that they retain a marginal role in regional economic restructuring even though significant resources have been devoted to the construction of local industrial districts. I argue that we are witnessing the emergence of localized competition (rather than cooperation) between small firms, between small and large locally dominant companies, and between small productive capital and finance capital. This experience suggests that we need to reconsider the suitability of 'western' development discourses in the context of transformation in Central and Eastern Europe.,,Research Article

The Politics of Partnership: The Role of Social Partners in Local Economic Development in Portugal,Stephen Syrett;;;;;Allan M.

Pratt;;;;;Keith Salmon;;;;;Mike Rawlinson;;;;;Michael Taylor;;;;;,1997,65,36,In the production of a dominant ideology for local economic policy, concepts of partnership currently play a key role. However, conceptualizations of partnership which inform the policy process are often weakened by a failure to recognize the unequal power relations between social partners, as well as by implicit assumptions of the existence of a range of partners available to be drawn into the local development process. This article explores current dominant notions of partnership and forms of economic governance and the role of international organizations in promoting particular ideologies of partnership. Through analysis of recent experiences in Portugal, this article examines how in practice the development of partnerships has been heavily constrained by the underdeveloped nature of local social partners, plus the unequal power relations between local and central state organizations and other locally based institutions. It is argued that policies promoting partnership must recognize these inequalities between partners and show awareness of the need to build up local institutional capacities for promoting economic development. Such policies are required in order to construct a politics of partnership embedded in democratic and participative processes of local development and to avoid the domination of the local development process by restricted local and national interests.,,Research Article

The first considers the limited literature on this under-researched topic and identifies the distinctiveness of both its international and European features. The second reviews the existing statistical data for north-south IRM in Europe, particularly from the UK to Italy, Malta, Portugal and Spain; it establishes both the scale and the geography of these migrations. In the third section we investigate some of the major influences on both the volume and the spatial pattern of IRM. Finally, in the fourth section, a brief review is presented of the economic, social and cultural implications of IRM for both the emigrants and their host communities.,,Research Article
Liberalized Utilities, New Technologies and Urban Social Polarization: The UK Experience,Stephen Syrett;;;;;Allan M.

Pratt;;;;;Keith Salmon;;;;;Mike Rawlinson;;;;;Michael Taylor;;;;;,1997,61,25,This article explores the urban social impacts of the radical liberalization and privatization of British utilities since the early 1 980s, and relates these impacts to broader shifts towards more socially fragmented cities. The article has three parts. The first part introduces the experimental political project through which British telecommunications, gas, water and electricity networks were privatized and liberalized during the 1980s. In the second part, the changing relationships between these key network utilities and the users of utility services are analysed and the broad logic of 'splintering networks' is identified. Three elements of this restructuring are explored: the 'rebalancing' of tariffs and cost-reflective pricing; the use of new metering technologies for 'cherry picking' affluent consumers while 'socially dumping' more marginal ones; and the development of new IT strategies for supporting the social construction of segmented markets. The concluding part of the article identifies the implications of the reorientation of utilities for social and spatial polarization within cities, and draws out implications for urban policy and research.,,Research Article
Spatial Divisions of Labour and the New Inter-Regional Imbalance in Spain,Stephen Syrett;;;;;Allan M.

Pratt;;;;;Keith Salmon;;;;;Mike Rawlinson;;;;;Michael Taylor;;;;;,1997,45,10,Restructuring of the productive system during recent decades, accompanied by rapid technological development, and parallel changes in modes of social and institutional regulation, define a new framework for the deep transformations that have characterized labour markets. However, individual territories react differently to these overall processes, according to their inherited structures (economic, sociodemographic, political and spatial), and the innovative capacities of their businesses, public bodies and social authorities. These factors contribute to a redistribution of the spatial division of labour. As a result, reference to national, regional and local labour markets has become commonplace in recent research, giving rise to controversies concerning, for example, their demarcation, thematic contents, the powers and factors which shape them, and dominant processes and trends. This article provides a framework for interpreting the features and the evolution of labour markets and then applies this to analysing tendencies in Spain's spatial division of labour.,,Research Article

The analysis indicates that the new situation in the Balkans provides Greece with an opportunity to overcome geographical isolation, and deal with its regional problems as well as the difficulties of the European integration process. It also provides the Balkan countries with an opportunity to interact and cooperate. From the strategic point of view, the long-term interests of Greece and the other countries in the region require stable relations, successful implementation of the policies of transition, and a policy mix promoting unification and coherence of the European economic space, the development of the European south-eastern region, and the facilitation of cross-border co-operation.,,Research Article

Beauregard;;;;;Claude Lacour;;;;;Neil Coe;;;;;H. W. Armstrong;;;;;Inga Lena Grønlund;;;;;Hans H. Blotevogel;;;;;Fred Robinson;;;;;Alan Townsend;;;;;Chris Pickvance;;;;;,1997,52,50,The attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) is increasingly a key economic development strategy for many countries in the EU. With FDI becoming more prevalent in producer service sectors, this article considers the example of non-market based investment in the computer services and, in particular, the software sector. Although the emergence of offshore data processing and programming are well chronicled, as software becomes increasingly standardized, international divisions of labour are also developing within the leading producers of standardized software packages. By the judicious targeting of FDI since the mid-1980s, Ireland, and in particular Dublin County, has developed into one of the leading centres for software package production in Europe. Many of the market-leading US companies have now established plants in Ireland, from which they manufacture and localize their products for the various European markets. This article will critically examine the role and nature of the overseas software sector in Ireland, with particular emphasis on the quality and stability of these investments. It would appear that while the promotional evidence and data may exaggerate the strategic importance of the Irish software industry, the nature of FDI in this sector is of a higher quality than previous rounds of manufacturing investment in Ireland.,,Research Article

However, the globalization of markets and the restructuring of production systems lead to an increased role for transportation in industrial strategies. The traditional framework dealing with transportation mainly as a cost thus becomes less relevant for understanding the spatial dynamics of industry.,,Research Article

Urban Regimes in a Europe of the Cities?,Alan Harding;;;;;Konstantinos A. Melachroinos;;;;;Nigel Spence;;;;;Tim Richardson;;;;;Ron Johnston;;;;;Charles Pattie;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;Mick Dunford;;;;;Douglas Hamilton;;;;;Richard Kotter;;;;;Adam Swain;;;;;,1997,128,191,This article uses concepts from the globalization debate and American urban political-economy literature to establish a framework within which the 'new' urban politics of production in Europe can be examined cross-nationally. Drawing upon research which applied this framework in five major European cities, it argues that (a) the urban politics of production has recently become more important cross-nationally and (b) there have been decisive, and relatively similar, changes in the motivations and actions of three major partners in urban development-central and local governments and local business communities. It suggests these changes, although significant, are unlikely to presage a 'Europe of the cities' in which citystates will reassume dominant roles in social and economic regulation.,,Research Article
Regional Productivity Dynamics of Manufacturing in Greece,Alan Harding;;;;;Konstantinos A.

As a result, it is not infrequently the case that this more or less sole focus on employment, although valuable in itself, produces an incomplete and sometimes some what distorted view of spatial economic change. The case of regional manufacturing restructuring in Greece during the 1970s and 1980s provides an example of the problems that over-concentration on employment can involve. By jointly examining the evolution of employment together with output, and the consequent labour productivity in the regions of Greece, the existence of two distinct geographies of uneven industrial expansion becomes apparent. The prefectures gaining most in terms of employment are not necessarily those gaining most in output. Although locally focused case-studies are probably what is required for a full understanding of the different facets of regional accumulation processes, the parallel examination of these three parameters provides a general idea of the possible different spatial outcomes of manufacturing expansion. It is this latter focus that is the purpose of this article.,,Research Article

Key events are charted by which the integration of environmental concerns came to hinge on a single contested issue-the adoption of Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA). The success of SEA in achieving environmental-policy integration is evaluated. An important aspect of this approach is to explore how the hegemonic discourses in the EU shape the policy process, and condition the success or failure of environmental integration. The article reflects on current debates about ecological modernization in the EU, arguing that the institutional learning model is inappropriate, and suggesting that understanding ecological modernization as cultural politics may bring a clearer understanding of the constructed nature of environmental-policy integration.,,Research Article

In Great Britain, the two main political parties have traditionally based their appeals around the country's class cleavage, with Labour support concentrated among the relatively deprived groups and areas the two 'two nations' pattern. Recent decades have seen a weakening of this class alignment, with voters' choices increasingly reflecting their perceived economic situations, plus those of their local areas and the country as a whole. Nevertheless, as the analyses reported here for 1995-96 show, the traditional two 'two nations' cleavages remain strong elements of the country's electoral geography.,,Research Article

Orthodox mapping is considered to be a useful way of portraying the continuing universal nature of gender inequality in employment alongside the wide, national and regional variations in the extent of the inequality. The maps also illustrate the growing feminization of employment in western Europe and the rapidity with which gender roles are changing. However, while reference is made to the gendered welfare regimes, gender arrangements and differentiated patriarchy explanations of gender inequality, caution is urged in terms of drawing inferences from changing gender roles in employment to wider changes in gender relations.,,Research Article
Economy, State or Culture?: Explanations for the Regional Variations in Gender Inequality in Swiss Employment,Diane Perrons;;;;;Lena Gonas;;;;;Diane Perrons;;;;;Elisabeth Buhler;;;;;Lena Gonas;;;;;Mireia Baylina;;;;;Maria Dolors Garcia-Ramon;;;;;Nota Kyriazis;;;;;Tim Coles;;;;;Michael P. Drury;;;;;Brian W. Ilbery;;;;;Joe Painter;;;;;Angus Cameron;;;;;Caedmon Staddon;;;;;Mo O'Toole;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;,1998,70,12,The proportion of women in top socioeconomic groups (managerial and professional jobs) is, apart from the size of the wages gap between women and men, the best measure of the degree of gender inequality in paid work. While there has been a remarkable quantitative expansion in female labourmarket participation in Switzerland and elsewhere, the proportion of women in positions with high-level decision-making power remains small. This article analyses the regional variations in gender inequality in Swiss employment for two different spatial dimensions: (a) 106 labour-market regions; and (b) four types of regions according to their position in the centre-periphery hierarchy. The results show that the proportion of women in positions of authority is considerably higher in the French and Italian-speaking regions than in similar German-speaking regions. Do these variations result from different cultural norms and values in different parts of Switzerland concerning gender relations? Are the French and Italian-speaking parts characterized by a more egalitarian gender culture? Or are there different concepts of the role of the welfare state inside Switzerland? Do the French and Italian-speaking cantons for instance offer better public provision to facilitate women's paid work? Or do these variations between the linguistic regions mainly conceal economic structures, for example different sectoral or branch structures in employment? This article discusses and assesses the usefulness of these three different theoretical approaches for providing an explanation of regional variations in gender inequalities in Swiss employment.,,Research Article

Drury;;;;;Brian W. Ilbery;;;;;Joe Painter;;;;;Angus Cameron;;;;;Caedmon Staddon;;;;;Mo O'Toole;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;,1998,49,4,The conditions for women's employment have changed profoundly in Sweden in the early 1990s. Employment rates are failing and unemployment rising. The changes are associated with a radical redirection of economic policy as economic stability has replaced full employment as the primary objective. Relatedly there has been a retraction and restructuring of the welfare state which plays a dual role as the facilitator of women's employment and their main labour market The implications for women of the simultaneous cuts in both of these spheres are investigated. The article explores the employment changes associated with this changing labour-market regime at national and regional levels. In particular, the implications of the new regime for women's ability to attain economic independence are studied by examining change on two key employment dimensions flexibility and stability.,,Research Article
Homeworking in Rural Spain: A Gender Approach,Diane Perrons;;;;;Lena Gonas;;;;;Diane Perrons;;;;;Elisabeth Buhler;;;;;Lena Gonas;;;;;Mireia Baylina;;;;;Maria Dolors Garcia-Ramon;;;;;Nota Kyriazis;;;;;Tim Coles;;;;;Michael P. Drury;;;;;Brian W. Ilbery;;;;;Joe Painter;;;;;Angus Cameron;;;;;Caedmon Staddon;;;;;Mo O'Toole;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;,1998,22,16,An increasing internationalization of economic activities in recent decades has led to relocation and restructuring of work processes in many parts of the world and in different sectors of the economy in labour-intensive industries. The search for greater flexibility in the labour market has enhanced the importance of 'atypical' work often falling within the so-called 'informal economy', in which female labour is prominent but can scarcely be traced in statistical records. A clear example of this restructuring in Southern Europe is industrial homeworking, which is carried out mainly by women within the context of the underground economy. In this article we try to shed light on the nature and function of women's industrial homeworking in different rural areas of Spain Catalonia, Valencia, Andalusia and Galicia - where economic restructuring has been particularly strong. While the type of work and the way home working is combined with other activities to boost household incomes varies between the regions, many of the women interviewees report similar experiences of homeworking, both positive and negative. In each case-study, however, it is clear that the choice to engage in homeworking is highly constrained. It is shaped by the restrictions deriving from gender roles and relations within the family and by the regional context.,,Research Article
Women'S Employment and Gender Relations in Greece: Forces of Modernization and Tradition,Diane Perrons;;;;;Lena Gonas;;;;;Diane Perrons;;;;;Elisabeth Buhler;;;;;Lena Gonas;;;;;Mireia Baylina;;;;;Maria Dolors Garcia-Ramon;;;;;Nota Kyriazis;;;;;Tim Coles;;;;;Michael P. Drury;;;;;Brian W. Ilbery;;;;;Joe Painter;;;;;Angus Cameron;;;;;Caedmon Staddon;;;;;Mo O'Toole;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;,1998,26,38,The purpose of this article is to examine the extent to which the modernizing changes experienced in Greece in the postwar period are reflected in more equitable gender relations. The analysis indicates that although Greece has become one of the most progressive countries with respect to women's legal status, this is not necessarily reflected in behavioural changes at the interpersonal level. The influx of Greek women in the labour market is a necessary prerequisite, but not a sufficient condition, for the development of a new gender contract. Given the persistence of traditional economic structures within which the family retains a significant role, women's involvement in paid employment does not in itself signify a transformation of gender relations. For a large proportion of Greek women, therefore, work may be viewed as the result of a family strategy for collective income procurement and not necessarily as an indicator of more liberal gender-role ideologies. The article concludes that it is vitally important to establish the meaning that work carries for women themselves, as well as others in their social environment, by supplementing statistical information with qualitative in-depth analyses.,,Research Article

Low-Tech Competitive Advantages and the Role Of Proximity: The Danish Wooden Furniture Industry,Peter Maskell;;;;;Nicholas A. Phelps;;;;;John Lovering;;;;;Kevin Morgan;;;;;Patsy Healey;;;;;Adrian Smith;;;;;Soňa Ferenčíková;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;David Sadler;;;;;Ronald Hall;;;;;Stephen Fothergill;;;;;David Sadler;;;;;,1998,65,105,The prevailing ethos of high-tech production makes it easy to forget that low-tech industries are not synonymous with low growth or low profitability. Even countries with some of the world's highest labour costs have based their economies on an ability to be competitive in labour-intensive, low-tech production. Furniture production is an excellent example of a huge and successful export-oriented European low-tech industry, which is mainly located where labour costs are highest. This article examines the peculiarities of the industry and highlights development within a single country, Denmark. It is argued that intensified exposure to international competition has led to a trend towards spatial agglomeration within the industry. It is further suggested that the enhanced demand for proximity between furniture producers is not based on utilizing the advantages of a geographical concentration of suppliers or customers, but rather on the ease of communication and exchange of knowledge when co-location gives rise to shared trust. Without the access to such intangible, localized capabilities it appears to be difficult for firms in this low-tech industry to survive. Sustained competitiveness and spatial proximity are thus closely interrelated.,,Research Article
Tying the Firm to the Region or Tying the Region to the Firm?: Early Observations on the Case of LG in South Wales,Peter Maskell;;;;;Nicholas A.

The investment would have been unthinkable without the unique institutional capacity involved with inward investment attraction and development which exists in Wales. However, the scale of the LG investment has placed enormous demands on this institutional capacity and raises questions regarding the way in which major investments effectively capture the strategic orientation and resources of local institutions and serviceproviding organizations. In this article we explore some of the main dimensions of such institutional capture as revealed by an initial examination of the LG case.,,Research Article
The Place of 'Europe' in Contemporary Spatial Strategy Making,Peter Maskell;;;;;Nicholas A. Phelps;;;;;John Lovering;;;;;Kevin Morgan;;;;;Patsy Healey;;;;;Adrian Smith;;;;;Soňa Ferenčíková;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;David Sadler;;;;;Ronald Hall;;;;;Stephen Fothergill;;;;;David Sadler;;;;;,1998,37,19,Within Western Europe, there is currently a reemergence of strategic spatial planning at the urban region scale. These new exercises in making strategic plans are characterized by vigorous efforts to build cohesive alliances including new stakeholders, often accompanied by well developed spatial images which express the position of urban regions. Within the policy discourses surrounding these processes, the metaphor of 'Europe' is frequently called into play. This has been interpreted by many commentators as a sign of a 'marketing style' in spatial planning, a form of newly emerging 'entrepreneurial' governance practices. In this article, drawing on a study of innovation in spatial strategy making in Europe, it is argued that the metaphor reflects different conceptions of space, place and territory, and is being used to perform different kinds of organizational work.,,Research Article
Inward Investment, Regional Transformations and Uneven Development in Eastern and Central Europe: Enterprise Case-Studies from Slovakia,Peter Maskell;;;;;Nicholas A.

This article seeks to examine the uneven regional development impacts of inward investment in Slovakia through a series of enterpriselevel and regional case-studies. The article contests the claims of the proponents of the role of inward investment in transition which suggest that a positive set of impacts will arise out of new corporate structures resulting from foreign investment. Through examining the locally specific impacts of inward manufacturing investment in relation to different corporate strategies, technology transfer and modernization, labour-market transformation and local supplier subcontracting, the article argues that reliance upon inward investment may not be the 'godsend' that many suggest it will be and that there is enormous diversity in the local impacts of new investment. The article concludes with a consideration of the role of inward investment in Europe's eastern periphery.,,Research Article

This article examines recent trends in the evolution of regional unemployment disparities across a number of European member states to determine whether and how far this reduction is occurring. There is in fact little indication of any widespread convergence of regional unemployment rates. Instead, regional unemployment disparities across Europe appear to be characterized by a high degree of persistence. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that this persistence is an equilibrium phenomenon rather than the result of prolonged disequilibrium in regional labour markets.,,Research Article
Coal Mining in Upper Silesia under Communism and Capitalism,Michelle Baddeley;;;;;Ron Martin;;;;;Peter Tyler;;;;;Ray Riley;;;;;Maria Tkocz;;;;;Steve Martin;;;;;Stefan Kratke;;;;;Brita Hermelin;;;;;David Brooksbank;;;;;David Pickernell;;;;;Leighton Morse;;;;;Michael Hebbert;;;;;Russell King;;;;;Judit Timir;;;;;Alfold Institute;;;;;Canan Balkir;;;;;Michael Keating;;;;;,1998,52,20,Arguing that models of the evolution of coal production pay insufficient attention to the economic, political and social environment external to the mine, this article analyses changes in the Upper Silesian coal-mining industry during communism and after within a top-down, bottom-up framework. Three spatial scales are recognized: macro, meso and micro. Prior to the soft revolution of 1989, the Soviet model of heavy industrialization and international trading conditions were important issues, while at the national scale the government structured the industry and gave miners a special place in Polish society. Coal pro-duction could also be related to political vicissitudes. At the local scale the spatial characteristics of the industry strongly correlated with geology, bottom-up forces being weak The international collapse of communism fundamentally changed the fortunes of the industry, but despite the free market, the government continues to exercise considerable influence. Bottom-up forces are now more important, the col- lieries having a degree of autonomy, while the devolution of considerable political power to the counties has led to the enforcement of environmen- tal protection regulations.,,Research Article
Eu Programmes and the Evolution of Local Economic Governance in the UK,Michelle Baddeley;;;;;Ron Martin;;;;;Peter Tyler;;;;;Ray Riley;;;;;Maria Tkocz;;;;;Steve Martin;;;;;Stefan Kratke;;;;;Brita Hermelin;;;;;David Brooksbank;;;;;David Pickernell;;;;;Leighton Morse;;;;;Michael Hebbert;;;;;Russell King;;;;;Judit Timir;;;;;Alfold Institute;;;;;Canan Balkir;;;;;Michael Keating;;;;;,1998,79,34,Empirical analyses of the activities and perceptions of a broad range of local authorities confirms the view that recent years have witnessed two key changes in local economic governance in the UK. First, the privileging of business interests by both European and domestic policy agendas has offered the private sector a far greater role in local regeneration partnerships. While there are doubts about the ability or willingness of businesses to make a meaningful contribution at the local level, the neoliberal agenda which has dominated policy making at the European level has had an important influence over the overall size and shape of the EU's structural funds. Second, local regeneration strategies have become increasingly dependent on EU programmes. This has provided the European Commission with greater influence over regeneration strategies in particular enabling it to encourage regional alliances between authorities. However, the overall pattern of local authorities' activity suggests that this has not led to the radical realignment of central-local relations envisaged by theories of multi-level governance. The strong 'gatekeeper' role of central government has meant that EU programmes have usually taken on a distinctly British flavour and that both the vertical and horizontal partnerships which have emerged in the UK have reflected a particular interpretation by central government of the principles embodied in the structural fund regulations. Very few British local authorities expect, or even aspire, to influence EU policy agendas. Current patterns of local economic governance in Britain are therefore best seen as the product of an increasingly fragmented European polity in which the power of local authorities has declined, the European Commission's influence has grown but central government has been able to retain a dominant position.,,Research Article
Problems of Cross-Border Regional Integration: The Case of the German-Polish Border Area,Michelle Baddeley;;;;;Ron Martin;;;;;Peter Tyler;;;;;Ray Riley;;;;;Maria Tkocz;;;;;Steve Martin;;;;;Stefan Kratke;;;;;Brita Hermelin;;;;;David Brooksbank;;;;;David Pickernell;;;;;Leighton Morse;;;;;Michael Hebbert;;;;;Russell King;;;;;Judit Timir;;;;;Alfold Institute;;;;;Canan Balkir;;;;;Michael Keating;;;;;,1998,41,42,In the framework of European integration there is a growing interest in the development of border re gions in East Central Europe. This article deals with the problems of regional integration in the German- Polish border region, following an approach that emphasizes the regions' economic organization, in stitutional fabric and sociocultural environment. New economic links between Western European and East-Central European firms do not necessarily lead to a revaluation of the border region or to the formation of transborder integrated economic regions. Instead, there is a tendency towards the de velopment of new economic links which overlook the border region. Up to now, cooperation between regional firms is weak within the border region. The region's sociocultural environment in terms of a 'low trust environment' and a specifically shaped social distance between the neighbouring regions are a fur ther hindrance to regional integration. These findings are being related to strategic options of re gional development policy in the border region.,,Research Article

This article considers location factors in the context of a conceptual discussion as well as a Swedish case- study. The conclusions suggest that there are reasons to reevaluate the relative importance of dif- ferent location factors. Although the factor of proximity to clients (the market) is important and tends to dominate the discussion in much research in geography, it offers only a partial explanation of the location of professional business services firms. This article produces arguments for the importance of several other location factors: professional labour, localization and urbanization economies, and the circumstances surrounding the establishment of firms as well as their subsequent history.,,Research Article
Reviving the Valleys of South Wales: Case-Study Evidence of a Link With Low Pay,Michelle Baddeley;;;;;Ron Martin;;;;;Peter Tyler;;;;;Ray Riley;;;;;Maria Tkocz;;;;;Steve Martin;;;;;Stefan Kratke;;;;;Brita Hermelin;;;;;David Brooksbank;;;;;David Pickernell;;;;;Leighton Morse;;;;;Michael Hebbert;;;;;Russell King;;;;;Judit Timir;;;;;Alfold Institute;;;;;Canan Balkir;;;;;Michael Keating;;;;;,1998,11,0,This commentary presents case-study evidence on aspects of the incidence of low pay in the European region of Wales. The interesting finding is that it appears to be firms relocating to Wales from elsewhere in the UK who pay lower wages for the same work. This has important implications for the perpetuation of low pay in subregions of Wales, and we find the potential for a mismatch in the employment-creation objectives of the current Welsh Development Agency (WDA). In addition, we suggest that the new Welsh assembly should play a vital role in ensuring that necessary higher-level employment forms part of future economic development.,,Research Article
An Evaluation of European Union Objective 2 Programmes in Industrial South Wales 1989-93,Robert Huggins;;;;;Proinnsias Breathnach;;;;;David Sadler;;;;;Brian Libery;;;;;Moya Kneafsey;;;;;Peter Friis;;;;;Tomas Vedsmand;;;;;Keith Chapman;;;;;Herbert Oberbeck;;;;;Rainer Oppermann;;;;;Mark Blacksell;;;;;Anders Malmberg;;;;;,1998,29,5,This article reports on an in-depth evaluation of European Union (EU) Objective 2 Structural Funding in Industrial South Wales (ISW). The central aim of the evaluation was to assess the main results obtained during the programming period 1989-93, as part of an analytical review of the main problems that ISW confronted during the programming experience. The major strategic objectives of the programme were tackled using six subprogrammes: industrial infrastructure; communications; business development; environment; tourism; research and development/vocational education and training facilities. Despite encountering numerous problems in the evaluation process, it was estimated that the programme created 2544 direct jobs, in addition to 7500 temporary construction jobs and the creation and upgrading of a range of physical infrastructure. Although there was an economic climate of recession during much of the programming period, the programme itself was seen to have positively and significantly contributed to the restructuring and diversification of the South Wales economy. It is suggested that the 'learning processes' associated with this programming period helped to 'push' funds in subsequent programming periods from projects concerned purely with physical assets to those involving human resource development. In conclusion, it is argued that following constitutional change in Wales, the opportunity exists within ISW to further converge EU, national, regional and local policies, producing further transparency and coherence in economic planning and regeneration strategies.,,Research Article
Exploring the 'Celtic Tiger' Phenomenon: Causes and Consequences of Ireland'S Economic Miracle,Robert Huggins;;;;;Proinnsias Breathnach;;;;;David Sadler;;;;;Brian Libery;;;;;Moya Kneafsey;;;;;Peter Friis;;;;;Tomas Vedsmand;;;;;Keith Chapman;;;;;Herbert Oberbeck;;;;;Rainer Oppermann;;;;;Mark Blacksell;;;;;Anders Malmberg;;;;;,1998,40,76,The economy of the Republic of Ireland has experienced continuously high growth rates in the 1990s, after a period of severe difficulty in the previous decade. As a result, Ireland is now within sight of exceeding average EU living standards, a situation which would reverse Ireland's traditional status as a peripheral European economy. The main purpose of this article is to examine the factors which have contributed to this apparent economic miracle, which has earned Ireland the 'Celtic Tiger' appellation. Particular importance is attached to the role of inward investment, which has grown in quantity and changed in quality in the last decade. These changes are attributed to general developments in the locational behaviour of transnational corporations, especially the need for access to skilled workers in an increasingly high-tech age. Such workers have become readily available in Ireland due to demographic change and state investment in education. However, while foreign branch plants have been upgrading their skill levels and their range of functions, they generally lack strategic responsibilities and independent decision-making powers.,,Research Article
Changing Inter-Firm Relations in the European Automotive Industry: Increased Dependence or Enhanced Autonomy for Components Producers?,Robert Huggins;;;;;Proinnsias Breathnach;;;;;David Sadler;;;;;Brian Libery;;;;;Moya Kneafsey;;;;;Peter Friis;;;;;Tomas Vedsmand;;;;;Keith Chapman;;;;;Herbert Oberbeck;;;;;Rainer Oppermann;;;;;Mark Blacksell;;;;;Anders Malmberg;;;;;,1998,25,31,This article explores the extent to which the benefits of new forms of inter-firm partnership within the European automotive industry have been shared between assemblers and component producers. It first considers the changing nature of the buyer-supplier relationship from the viewpoint of different parties and as part of a process of restructuring within the filiere. Then it documents patterns of performance, comparing samples of five European vehicle assemblers and ten component firms from 1987 to 1996. Evidence is presented on R&D and capital investment expenditures, inventory levels and work-inprogress, and profitability. It is concluded that lead- ing component manufacturers proved more resilient and adaptable than the assemblers during the early 1990s. This is explained in terms of the position of these system integrators with respect to their own suppliers, and the differing sectoral and geographical configurations of assembly and leading component firms.,,Research Article
Product and Place: Promoting Quality Products and Services in the Lagging Rural Regions of the European Union,Robert Huggins;;;;;Proinnsias Breathnach;;;;;David Sadler;;;;;Brian Libery;;;;;Moya Kneafsey;;;;;Peter Friis;;;;;Tomas Vedsmand;;;;;Keith Chapman;;;;;Herbert Oberbeck;;;;;Rainer Oppermann;;;;;Mark Blacksell;;;;;Anders Malmberg;;;;;,1998,75,223,Quality products and services (niche markets) could be an important instrument of rural development in the lagging regions of the European Union. However, there is little research which relates product to place in a rural context. After providing a brief insight into aspects of agricultural and rural restructuring, the article reviews existing literature and relevant concepts under the separate headings of 'Constructing quality' and 'Constructing regional images: linking product to place'. Many of these ideas are being applied in an interdisciplinary and international (EU) research project which attempts to link specific quality products and services to specific regions. The aims of RIPPLE are outlined in the hope of encouraging more research into the links between quality products and rural places.,,Research Article
From Resource-To Knowledge-Based Production?: The Case of the Danish Fishing Industry,Robert Huggins;;;;;Proinnsias Breathnach;;;;;David Sadler;;;;;Brian Libery;;;;;Moya Kneafsey;;;;;Peter Friis;;;;;Tomas Vedsmand;;;;;Keith Chapman;;;;;Herbert Oberbeck;;;;;Rainer Oppermann;;;;;Mark Blacksell;;;;;Anders Malmberg;;;;;,1998,30,1,The Danish fishing industry has experienced a harsh economic situation within the last decade due to a decline in the most important fish stocks and in-creasing overcapacity. Furthermore, changes in the market for fish and fish products has caused de-creasing prices in the traditional markets. As Danish producers cannot expect extraordinary increases in catches, the future success of the Danish fishing in-dustry may depend upon altering fishing patterns to bring them in line with market demands. However, this would require a vigorous exchange of market in-telligence within the production chain. This article identifies those institutional paths which are hinder-ing progress towards a knowledge-rather than resource-based industry and concludes that the survival of the Danish fishing industry depends on its ability to adapt to changes in the international market via a strong cast of 'market intelligent' players.,,Research Article
Restructuring of the European Fertilizer Industry: National Patterns in Continental Perspective,Robert Huggins;;;;;Proinnsias Breathnach;;;;;David Sadler;;;;;Brian Libery;;;;;Moya Kneafsey;;;;;Peter Friis;;;;;Tomas Vedsmand;;;;;Keith Chapman;;;;;Herbert Oberbeck;;;;;Rainer Oppermann;;;;;Mark Blacksell;;;;;Anders Malmberg;;;;;,1998,47,11,Studies of recent changes in the structure of the European production system have focused upon relatively few sectors. The experience of the EU fertilizer industry since the early 1980s is reviewed. It demonstrates a combination of organizational and spatial concentration consistent with the anticipated effects of economic integration upon a mature, declining industry with a history of serving fragmented national markets. This interpretation is, however, superficial. Observed changes are the outcomes of multiple processes and agencies. Many of these have operated at national, rather than European scales. Government intervention, reflecting the strategic significance of the fertilizer industry for agricultural policy, has been an important influence in several countries. This strategic dimension has also influenced the commercial evolution of the industry. Although fertilizers have played an important role in the business histories of some of Europe's largest multinational corporations (MNCs) such as BASF and IC, this role has been largely restricted to domestic production facilities. The assumption that the configuration of the evolving European production system will be determined by the continental vision of large MNCs is, therefore, not appropriate. Only two, Scandinanvian-based companies have, as a result of essentially opportunistic expansion by cross-bor-der acquisitions, moved in the direction of a pan-European strategy.,,Research Article

Glasmeier;;;;;Sytze A.

Innovation and Proximity: Territories as Loci of Collective Learning Processes,Anders Malmberg;;;;;Peter Maskell;;;;;Peter Maskell;;;;;Anders Malmberg;;;;;Thierry Kirat;;;;;Yannick Lung;;;;;Kurt Fuellhart;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;Amy K. Glasmeier;;;;;Sytze A. Rienstra;;;;;Piet Rietveld;;;;;,1999,48,336,The article focuses on the relationship between technological and organizational innovation, and territories. This relationship is connected to interactions between learning processes, institutions and spatial patterns of innovative activities. Starting from a conception of the economy as a learning and evolutionary process instead of a static allocative mechanism, we analyse the role of several types of proximity in innovative processes. If one considers innovation as a problem-solving oriented process, it may be analysed as grounded on non-market inter-actions, and knowledge-based. The article shows how geographical, organizational and institutional proximities relate to the operation of localized innovation systems. The institutional framework is of particular importance in this context owing to the fact that such innovation systems are grounded on collective action at a territorial level and rely upon shared patterns of behavioural and cognitive rules. The analysis of institutional proximity raises the problems of the embeddedness of interrelations between actors in a territorial framework, and the transferability of tacit knowledge. This framework is extended to the analysis of spatial patterns in the emergence and diffusion of industrial models. In our conception, the emergence of an industrial model has territorial foundations, but it is also dependent upon an institutional learning process. However, once stabilized and diffused, its relation to geography and territories evolves and transforms. We illustrate this analysis by referring to the emergence and diffusion of industrial models in the automobile industry. Finally, the framework is used to analyse the spatial effects of organizational changes in product development. These changes are both institutional and technological.,,Research Article

Rienstra;;;;;Piet Rietveld;;;;;,1999,114,36,Business scholars have long emphasized the need for a continuous flow of strategic, tactical and operational information in order for decision makers to make informed organizational choices. However, much of the practical and theoretical work on ‘organizational learning’ and ‘environmental scanning’ has been aspatial and focused on the large corporation. Researchers of small business dynamics and entrepreneurship have measured firms’ use of information sources, but this work also remains largely aspatial. Geographers have only begun to scratch the surface of the relationships between forms of industrial spatial organization and the use of specific information sources at a firm level.,,Research Article
‘The Learning Economy, the Learning Firm and the Learning Region’: A Sympathetic Critique of the Limits to Learning,Anders Malmberg;;;;;Peter Maskell;;;;;Peter Maskell;;;;;Anders Malmberg;;;;;Thierry Kirat;;;;;Yannick Lung;;;;;Kurt Fuellhart;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;Amy K. Glasmeier;;;;;Sytze A. Rienstra;;;;;Piet Rietveld;;;;;,1999,64,287,The recent growing interest in ‘learning’ and ‘knowledge’ as a - maybe the (only) - route to corporate and regional economic success is one facet of the engagement between economic geographers and regional analysts on the one hand and evolutionary and institutional economists on the other. This focus on knowledge is often presented as a dramatic breakthrough, promising radical theoretical reappraisal and opening up exciting new possibilities for the conception, implementation and practise of policy. Recognizing the importance of innovation and knowledge creation to economic success is hardly novel, however. The paper first summarizes the claims made by the proponents of ‘learning’, and some links are drawn between the pre-eminent emphasis that they place upon knowledge and learning and other literatures that analyse ongoing changes in the organization of production and work in contemporary capitalism and which have different emphases. The aim is to situate and contextualize claims about the significance of ‘learning’. These claims are then placed within the context of continuities and changes within capitalism, and the ways in which these have been understood, as a further step in this process of contextualization and situation. Finally, some conclusions are briefly drawn around the limits to learning, and questions of learning by whom, and for what purpose, in the context of the politics and policies of social, economic and territorial development.,,Research Article
Territory-Based Regional Development Policy and Planning in a Learning Economy: The Case of ‘Real Service Centers’ in Industrial Districts,Anders Malmberg;;;;;Peter Maskell;;;;;Peter Maskell;;;;;Anders Malmberg;;;;;Thierry Kirat;;;;;Yannick Lung;;;;;Kurt Fuellhart;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;Amy K. Glasmeier;;;;;Sytze A. Rienstra;;;;;Piet Rietveld;;;;;,1999,23,51,In addressing the intersections between territory-based regional industrial development programs and the challenges faced by firms in the emerging information-based economy, a prerequisite for a more holistic approach to region-wide economic policy development and planning is a public-sector strategic outlook that itself is informed about economic, sectoral and strategic trends and which is built around an understanding of organizational learning. The requirement for public sector ‘know-how’ and ‘know-why’ deviates substantially from past practice wherein the knowledge of sectoral change and economic trends was embedded in separate programs created to provide services to firms. Absent from this model is a feedback loop which builds this understanding into policy making and program design.,,Research Article

Prospecting for New Jobs to Combat Social Exclusion: The Example of Home-Care Services,Ruth Young;;;;;Sarah Waters;;;;;Joachim Becker;;;;;Andreas Novy;;;;;Allan Cochrane;;;;;Andrew Jonas;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;David Sadler;;;;;Gyula Horváth;;;;;Suzanne Hodge;;;;;Joe Howe;;;;;,1999,70,11,In its White Papers on European Social Policy and Growth, Competitiveness and Employment the European Commission (1994a; 1994b) highlighted the need to create alternative employment opportunities through the promotion of new fields of economic activity. The provision of services by non-statutory providers to older and disabled people in their own homes was one of the 19 employment fields identified (European Commission, 1998a). In the UK, considerable impetus has been given to the development of independent-sector domiciliary services by recent policies which combine care in the community with the introduction of competition to publicly funded social care. The responsibility for enabling social-care markets has been given to local authorities not in the capacity as main service provider, as historically was the case, but as the purchaser of services on behalf of individual users. This article explores the labour-market outcomes of local-authority contracting arrangements with independent-sector providers. It outlines providers’ arguments that current purchasing practices exacerbate the difficulties of recruiting, developing and retaining workers which arise from the highly fragmented nature of home-care itself. Importantly, existing outcomes appear counterproductive to the aim of achieving social and economic inclusion through the promotion of high-quality jobs in the independent sector. The article concludes that, in order to achieve the sector’s potential to recruit from the long-term unemployed, local authorities must approach their enabling role from the emerging EU policy perspective of Community Economic Development (CED) (European Commission, 1996a). Specifically, by employing ‘the community’ as the platform for service delivery, the problems of matching labour demand and supply in the sector could more effectively be addressed. Although immediately relevant in the UK context, these arguments have important implications for the development of home care as an employment field across the EU in general.,,Research Article
Chambers of Commerce in Italy: A Model of Cooperative Development?,Ruth Young;;;;;Sarah Waters;;;;;Joachim Becker;;;;;Andreas Novy;;;;;Allan Cochrane;;;;;Andrew Jonas;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;David Sadler;;;;;Gyula Horváth;;;;;Suzanne Hodge;;;;;Joe Howe;;;;;,1999,19,5,This article looks at the role of the Italian chambers of commerce, examining the ways in which they contribute to local development. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of cooperation among interests as a key feature of endogenous growth. Organizations and interests which cooperate for purposes of economic intervention are seen to be particularly effective in managing growth. Italian chambers appear on the surface to have a strong potential for ‘cooperative endogenous development’. Unique among local organizations, the chambers provide an on-going structure for interaction and exchange among local economic interests. These are powerful organizations which have extensive resources and competences. Yet despite this considerable potential, we will see that the chambers do not tend to assume a prominent role in supporting economic growth. They are often confined to narrow regulatory functions and remain excluded from processes of economic innovation. The article examines the economic performance of the Italian chambers of commerce, drawing on empirical work carried out on three different chambers. It will consider why these seemingly powerful organizations do not in practice act as agencies of cooperative endogenous development.,,Research Article
Divergence and Convergence of National and Local Regulation: The Case of Austria and Vienna,Ruth Young;;;;;Sarah Waters;;;;;Joachim Becker;;;;;Andreas Novy;;;;;Allan Cochrane;;;;;Andrew Jonas;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;David Sadler;;;;;Gyula Horváth;;;;;Suzanne Hodge;;;;;Joe Howe;;;;;,1999,79,9,From a regulationist perspective, this article analyses the conditions under which local and national modes of development can diverge. Taking the modern history of Vienna and Austria as an example, the article considers the dialectics of accumulation strategies and national and local state projects. Four relevant historical periods can be distinguished. The more general conclusion is that heterogeneous regional development is only a necessary (but not a sufficient) condition for a local state project to diverge from the national one. It seems that popular forces can only establish a counter-project at the local level if the national dominant bloc fails to gain mass acceptance for its ideological dispensation and an emerging counter-bloc is able to capitalize on this weakness by formulating its own social project.,,Research Article
Reimagining Berlin: World City, National Capital or Ordinary Place?,Ruth Young;;;;;Sarah Waters;;;;;Joachim Becker;;;;;Andreas Novy;;;;;Allan Cochrane;;;;;Andrew Jonas;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;David Sadler;;;;;Gyula Horváth;;;;;Suzanne Hodge;;;;;Joe Howe;;;;;,1999,72,111,Globalization has had a dramatic effect on the way in which we understand the operation of urban systems. Cities - or their elites - have increasingly sought to redefine and reimagine themselves through place marketing in ways which allow them to compete in the global marketplace. The ‘exceptional’ case of Berlin is explored in the context of regional and global restructuring. Berlin has been at the centre of dramatic changes over the last decade and has been forced to reimagine itself in quite a different set of global understandings. A series of different - competing and sometimes complementary - imaginary Berlins are being constructed in the process of reinsertion into ‘normal’ capitalist urbanization. The relationships between property-led visions with Berlin at the heart of a wider Europe, visions of Berlin as a revived capital of a united Germany and the redefinition of Berlin as an ordinary place are considered. Each of these visions offers a different interpretation of Berlin. The paper critically assesses the extent to which it is possible to escape from pro-growth agendas in developing an urban future for the city and explores some of the implications of Berlin’s current development trajectory.,,Research Article

The Meaning of Work: Some Arguments for the Importance of Culture within Formulations of Work in Europe,David Sadler;;;;;Nicky Gregson;;;;;Kirsten Simonsen;;;;;Dina Vaiou;;;;;Benito Giordano;;;;;Gordon MacLeod;;;;;Ricardo Aláez Aller;;;;;Javier Bilbao Ubillos;;;;;Vicente Camino Beldarrain;;;;;Juan Carlos Longás García;;;;;David C. Gibbs;;;;;Simon Guy;;;;;Simon Marvin;;;;;Graham Haughton;;;;;Grazia Brunetta;;;;;Egidio Dansero;;;;;,1999,57,36,This paper is concerned with examining the meaning of different forms of work found within the EU. Despite the increasing acknowledgement of the importance of the diversity of work forms within Europe, both within the Commission and the European academic literature, it is argued that existing formulations are highly problematic. Existing research, both academic and policy-related, is shown to be characterized by a bewildering terminology, which is often used interchangeably, and which works to reinscribe existing lines of power within the EU. Moreover, this work is shown to be theoretically problematic. The centrality of distinct measurable categories to representations of the diversity of contemporary work within the EU is argued to be a way of thinking which constructs difference in terms of statistical differences, which encourages homogenizing and oppositional representations of North and South, and which also facilitates thinking as the same that which may be very different. Correspondingly, we argue for an alternative analysis of the diversity of work forms, one which is grounded in the different meanings these forms assume in different cultural contexts. Taking three categories of ‘atypical’ work (part-time, self-employed and undeclared) in three EU member states (Greece, Denmark and the UK), the paper proceeds by demonstrating how categories which are constructed as same/different statistically are rather more complicated when considered in terms of the meanings invested in them. The categories of work are argued to be contextually and culturally embedded; they are inscribed with and reconstituted through culturally specific sets of meanings in each of the three member states under consideration. We conclude the paper by reflecting on the possibilities opened up by this kind of analysis, its implications regarding debates over European labour markets, and its positioning with respect to debates over the relationship between the cultural and the economic.,,Research Article

Gibbs;;;;;Simon Guy;;;;;Simon Marvin;;;;;Graham Haughton;;;;;Grazia Brunetta;;;;;Egidio Dansero;;;;;,1999,22,25,In the 1990s, the debates about the resurgence of political regionalism in Europe have become particularly prevalent. One reason for this has been the fact that, in several European countries, regionalist political parties have made significant electoral gains in recent years. This paper focuses upon Italy, which is one of the countries in which there has been a significant resurgence of regionalism over the last ten years or so. Political regionalism is not a new phenomenon in Italy and there have been a number of examples of regionalist political parties during the history of the Italian Republic. However, it is the rise to political prominence of the Northern League (Lega Nord) (LN) political party in Italian politics which has brought to the fore questions about Italian national unity and identity. The party has articulated a new and politically more contentious ‘Northern question’, which is superimposed upon the longstanding ‘Southern question’ in Italy.,,Research Article

Gibbs;;;;;Simon Guy;;;;;Simon Marvin;;;;;Graham Haughton;;;;;Grazia Brunetta;;;;;Egidio Dansero;;;;;,1999,115,182,In analyzing the contemporary ‘recomposition of political space’ some researchers are drawing an inference between a putative ‘hollowing out’ of the state or ‘multi-level’ governance, and the growth of integrated economic development programmes enacted through closer articulation between local and regional political coalitions and the European Commission. This coupling of urban and regional analysis with state restructuring and re-scaling represents a welcome direction. There is, nevertheless, a real danger that such analysis simply ‘reads off’ emergent associationalist trends between EU institutions and regional alliances, or Euro-regionalism, as some inevitable outcome of a hastening trajectory towards a globalizing and Europeanizing economy and ‘hollowed out’ national states. Such an approach would fail to uncover the key social processes and ‘constituent relationships’ (Sayer, 1989) that activate these trends in particular places.,,Research Article

Is Political Economy Still Relevant to Study the Culturalization of Cities?,Ash Amin;;;;;Patrick Le Galès;;;;;Rob Shields;;;;;Kirsten Simonsen;;;;;Dina Vaiou;;;;;John Tomlinson;;;;;Andrew Sayer;;;;;Stefan Krätke;;;;;Peter Sjøholt;;;;;Jens Christian Hansen;;;;;Milan Buc<caron>ek;;;;;Martin Eaton;;;;;,1999,64,23,In order to analyse and explain the growing importance of culture in cities, this article briefly reviews three traditions of urban political economy (Marxist, neo-classical and neo-Weberian). The paper argues that rather than looking for a new embracing reductionist cultural studies paradigm, it is probably more fruitful to work on the combination of culture, social structures, economics and politics, for instance in the Weberian or neo-Gramscian tradition. It is therefore argued that an opened political economy of cities must take culture more seriously than in the past but that there is no reason to reject political economy (or economic sociology) to work on the culturalization of cities.,,Research Article
Culture and the Economy of Cities,Ash Amin;;;;;Patrick Le Galès;;;;;Rob Shields;;;;;Kirsten Simonsen;;;;;Dina Vaiou;;;;;John Tomlinson;;;;;Andrew Sayer;;;;;Stefan Krätke;;;;;Peter Sjøholt;;;;;Jens Christian Hansen;;;;;Milan Buc<caron>ek;;;;;Martin Eaton;;;;;,1999,54,32,A division of social processes into different, mutually exclusive ‘value spheres’ such as ‘cultural’ or ‘economic’ derives from a 19th-century, European model of civil society. This model cannot respond to current political demands for cultural recognition and redistributive justice which characterize multicultural societies. It does not acknowledge the economic importance of knowledge work. Spatially located analyses, such as in urban and regional research, offer an ideal opportunity to marry analytical approaches to capture the convergence of cultural and economic processes in given localities. Attempts within political economy to integrate culture as a force of governance have tended to oversimplify the cultural aspects of economic activity as, for example, discourse. A ‘cultural-economic’ approach emphasizing place and context is proposed.,,Research Article

Berlin’s Regional Economy in the 1990S: Structural Adjustment or ‘Open-Ended’ Structural Break?,Ash Amin;;;;;Patrick Le Galès;;;;;Rob Shields;;;;;Kirsten Simonsen;;;;;Dina Vaiou;;;;;John Tomlinson;;;;;Andrew Sayer;;;;;Stefan Krätke;;;;;Peter Sjøholt;;;;;Jens Christian Hansen;;;;;Milan Buc<caron>ek;;;;;Martin Eaton;;;;;,1999,28,27,Berlin’s reinstatement as the capital of Germany has raised great expectations of its transformation into a major European metropolis. Some people even claim that Berlin is moving in the direction of becoming a ‘global city’. A more common interpretation of the structural changes in Berlin’s economy sees the current developments in the regional economy as a process of structural adjustment with the West German metropolitan regions, assuming that Berlin is in transition to catch up with the economic centres of the poly-central German regional system. This position is highly questionable, since first it ignores the overall trend towards a polarization between urban regions in terms of their economic performance, their different sectoral specialization profiles and innovative capacity; and second it is based on a highly simplified concept of the metropolitan regions’ economic structure, the concept of a ‘service metropolis’. The purpose of this article is to undertake a critical appraisal of the vision of Berlin as a service metropolis through empirical observation of sectoral trends and specialization profiles in four metropolitan regions of Germany. The comparative analysis of Berlin and major metropolitan regions in Germany comes to the conclusion that the notion of a common development path of metropolitan regions’ economies is misleading. In contrast to the structural adjustment thesis, the development of Berlin in the 1990s might be better characterized as an ‘open-ended’ structural break.,,Research Article

It examines the historical development of the town, linking these changes to wider transformations, including the construction of socialism in Poland, reform socialism in the 1960s and 1970s, the collapse of the Soviet-style economy in Poland in the 1980s and the creation of new market economies in the 1990s. Central to this restructuring is the fate of the town’s steelworks, once the largest in Europe and now undergoing privatization. The article argues that localities are, at least in part, constructed in the image of the dominant relations of production and authority, and that, in turn, economic, social and political practices in particular places play a role in constructing those relations.,,Research Article

In the global economy, urban and economic development matters are being interpreted within the governance framework. As a consequence of the lack of a formal statutory metropolitan political focus within the UK over the last 30 years, much of this debate has invariably focused on one scale: the city or the local. But the New Labour Government’s political and administrative restructuring of the institutions and regions of governance is reconfiguring the city development issue onto another level. In future, it will be possible to view the urban governance issue from the perspective of a much broader framework, involving issues relating to urban policies within institutions operating at the regional level. This article is intended to chart the development of a push towards city-region planning and governance in the UK. It focuses specifically on political and institutional restructuring as a catalyst to a reconceptualization of the urban problem, and assesses four key components that have engendered this sense of strategic policy making over the last few years: central government funding opportunities through partnerships; the emergence of regional planning; the creation of regional development agencies with an urban remit; and opportunities provided by European Union funding mechanisms. The article concludes by outlining possible future directions for city regions and identifies where future research is required.,,Research Article
Suburbanization and the Clash of Urban Regimes: Developmental Problems of East German Cities in a Free Market Environment,Alison Stenning;;;;;Mark Tewdwr-Jones;;;;;Donald McNeill;;;;;Peter Franz;;;;;Domingos Santos;;;;;John Bachtler;;;;;Ruth Downes;;;;;Costis Hadjimichalis;;;;;Norma Carter;;;;;Fernando Nunes da Silva;;;;;Fernanda Magalhães;;;;;,2000,28,13,Since 1990, the date of German reunification, urban development, and especially the recovery of inner cities in East Germany, has been delayed by several factors including real estate restitution claims, inflexible preservation codes for historic buildings, and the shortage of stores for retailers. This blockade situation has resulted in the quick and intensified development of shopping centres as ‘inner city substitutes’ on the urban periphery. The combined effect of the factors preventing revitalization strategies and the newly realized and practised potential for autonomous action by the authorities of smaller municipalities has been to severely restrict the governing capacities of the authorities of the larger cities. In regaining their capability city governments are dependent on urban groups joining and supporting public developmental strategies. Such groups can be described as urban regimes. In Germany three types of regime can be differentiated. The cities differ with respect to the political strength and the forms of coalition and conflict between different urban regimes. Specific conditions in East Germany have led to a special regime constellation with a powerful ‘conservation regime’ on the one hand and a vivid ‘globalization regime’ on the other. This conflicting constellation results in a developmental blockade. The hypothesis is that a third regime type, the ‘local alliance’, is missing and still has to be created by practices such as city marketing and city management. Only when this regime-building process has advanced will new constellations of political coalitions and compromise become possible and be able to reduce governance problems of city government in the long run.,,Research Article
Innovation and Territory: Which Strategies to Promote Regional Innovation Systems in Portugal?,Alison Stenning;;;;;Mark Tewdwr-Jones;;;;;Donald McNeill;;;;;Peter Franz;;;;;Domingos Santos;;;;;John Bachtler;;;;;Ruth Downes;;;;;Costis Hadjimichalis;;;;;Norma Carter;;;;;Fernando Nunes da Silva;;;;;Fernanda Magalhães;;;;;,2000,38,26,The first part of this article examines the concept of regional innovation systems against the background of modern theories of innovation and regional policies. It is argued that the role of localized learning is of strategic importance in the promotion of endogenous regional development. With reference to current research on regional policy, the author also argues that sustainable regional strength is built on a continuously upgraded knowledge base, rather than on general factor endowment. By stimulating localized learning, the regional innovation systems have an important role to play and offer possibilities of producing regional competitive advantage. The author then suggests how regional innovation systems can be organized in order to increase innovation at various levels. Finally, some sketches are provided of various innovation strategies operating at the regional level from which lessons of direct policy relevance may be learned and adapted to the Portuguese context.,,Research Article

Clusters, Supply Chains and Local Embeddedness in Fyrstad,Ross Brown;;;;;Gerald Schneider;;;;;Thomas Plümper;;;;;Steffen Baumann;;;;;Neil Brenner;;;;;Dylan Henderson;;;;;Heiko Prange;;;;;Kiki Kafkoula;;;;;,2000,45,57,In recent years, there has been a proliferation of regional development policies designed to promote and develop regional clusters. Regional policymakers in Europe strive to develop local clusters to promote regional economic growth mainly through supply chain development initiatives, particularly in regions dominated by branch plants of large multinational enterprises. This article explores the role played by two large firms in developing linkages with local suppliers in the small regional economy of Fyrstad, west Sweden. Using a case-study approach, the investigation examines the main methods through which Saab Automobile and Volvo Aero Corporation develop suppliers within the local automotive and aerospace clusters. Overall, the research discovers that local sourcing is low and local supply chains are dominated by small, low value-added suppliers providing basic parts and repair services. The region lacks high-technology, fast-growing first and second-tier suppliers. The research also shows that the problems facing the supply chain in the automotive cluster are different from the aerospace cluster and that supplier linkages within the aerospace cluster appear to be more beneficial for long-term regional development. Finally, policy recommendations to aid each cluster are highlighted.,,Research Article
Bringing Putnam to the European Regions: On the Relevance of Social Capital for Economic Growth,Ross Brown;;;;;Gerald Schneider;;;;;Thomas Plümper;;;;;Steffen Baumann;;;;;Neil Brenner;;;;;Dylan Henderson;;;;;Heiko Prange;;;;;Kiki Kafkoula;;;;;,2000,60,99,One of the most influential contributions to the study of political culture of the 1990s was Robert D. Putnam’s book on the positive impact that interpersonal trust supposedly has on economic welfare and the effectiveness of political institutions in Italy. Making Democracy Work showed in bivariate correlations that progress depends largely on the social capital manifest in the Italian regions. We evaluate this hypothesis in a wider sample of regions by analysing quantitatively the role that political culture has on economic growth in the regions of the European Union (EU). We first develop a neoclassical growth model and incorporate political culture variables into this framework. Our cross-sectional regression results cast some doubts on the generalizability of Putnam’s bold claims. The analysis particularly shows, in accordance with standard models of economic growth, that economic rather than cultural factors are the most forceful determinants of growth in the European regions. Only one dimension of political culture, the intensity of social communication, has the expected positive impact.,,Research Article
Building ‘Euro-Regions’: Locational Politics and the Political Geography of Neoliberalism in Post-Unification Germany,Ross Brown;;;;;Gerald Schneider;;;;;Thomas Plümper;;;;;Steffen Baumann;;;;;Neil Brenner;;;;;Dylan Henderson;;;;;Heiko Prange;;;;;Kiki Kafkoula;;;;;,2000,117,160,Against the background of recent debates on state spatial restructuring in the European Union (EU), this article elaborates a critical geographical interpretation of the contemporary debate on locational competitiveness (Standortdebatte) in the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). On the one hand, the current debate on Standort Deutschland (Germany as an investment location) represents the growing instability of the ‘Rhine model’ of capitalism under conditions of accelerating globalization and European integration. In this aspect, the contemporary locational debate has served to justify various forms of deregulation and institutional erosion at each level within the German political system. On the other hand, the contemporary locational debate has also entailed the delineation of new subnational geographical targets for major socio-economic policies. The protection and enhancement of nationally specific competitive advantages within an integrated European economy is increasingly seen to hinge upon the construction of ‘Euro-regions’ associated with territorially specific conditions of production, socio-economic assets and institutional forms at subnational scales.The politics of deregulation in post-unification Germany have therefore been closely intertwined with a broader reterritorialization and re-scaling of state power in which new subnational institutional spaces are being mobilized as the geographical spearheads for renewed economic growth. These arguments are illustrated with reference to two major realms of debate on locational competitiveness in the post-unification era, each of which has entailed a distinctive scalar articulation of neoliberal political agendas: the regionalization of national spatial planning policies (Raumordnungspolitik); and the debate on ‘competition federalism’ (Wettbewerbs-föderalismus) and fiscal equalization (Finanzausgleich) among the German Länder. However, against essentializing interpretations of subnational regions as privileged geographical loci for neocorporatist social compromises or for post-Fordist spatial fixes, contemporary regionalization processes in the FRG are conceptualized here as an institutional medium through which the German state is engaging in strategies of crisis-management.,,Research Article
EU Regional Innovation Strategies: Regional Experimentalism in Practice?,Ross Brown;;;;;Gerald Schneider;;;;;Thomas Plümper;;;;;Steffen Baumann;;;;;Neil Brenner;;;;;Dylan Henderson;;;;;Heiko Prange;;;;;Kiki Kafkoula;;;;;,2000,56,41,This article reviews the emergence of regional policy initiatives designed to stimulate learning, innovation and regional development in Europe’s less favoured regions. Drawing on the European Commission-sponsored Wales Regional Technology Plan as a case study, it examines progress and outcomes using the conceptual framework of regional experimentalism. The article concludes that the Wales RTP has helped to develop significant interactive learning processes among the regional state, firms and intermediaries. Important questions, however, are raised as to whether the RTP process in Wales has engendered the sufficiently path-breaking forms of dialogue anticipated by theorists. In this respect, the article suggests that regional experimentalism under-estimates the problems associated with creating novel policy processes in environments characterized by well entrenched interests and responsibilities.,,Research Article

Naples: Urban Regeneration and Exclusion in the Italian South,Frank Moulaert;;;;;Erik Swyngedouw;;;;;Arantxa Rodriguez;;;;;Serena Vicari;;;;;Guy Baeten;;;;;Andreas Novy;;;;;Vanessa Redak;;;;;Johannes Jäger;;;;;Alexander Hamedinger;;;;;Frank Moulaert;;;;;Elodie Salin;;;;;Thomas Werquin;;;;;Arantxa Rodríguez;;;;;Elena Martínez;;;;;Galder Guenaga;;;;;,2001,37,25,This article analyses the socio-economic impact of the Naples business centre (CDN), a large redevelopment project for a complex of offices and residences built in the core of the metropolitan area of Naples over the last two decades. Naples, one of the major cities in the underdeveloped regions of the south of Italy, presents specific processes of social exclusion and polarization. Currently the city faces the restructuring of the local economic system as well as the problems generated by its historical path of development. The article begins with a discussion of the main dimensions of social, economic and political exclusion. In this context, it discusses the two fundamental sources of exclusion in Naples: labour problems (unemployment, informal work and the impact of a clientelistic welfare policy) and the lack of a ruling framework of legality (new links between organized crime and the political system, widespread corruption, money-laundering). It then describes and evaluates the city’s urban policy and strategy in the face of these problems over the last three decades. The decision-making and implementation processes of the CDN are described and an account given of the dynamics of the public-private partnership involved in its development. The final section evaluates the physical, economic and social impact of the CDN project and demonstrates that it has not only failed to address the principal problems of the city but has actually aggravated them.,local development;Naples;social exclusion;urban regeneration,Research Article
The Europeanization of Brussels and the Urbanization of ‘Europe’: Hybridizing the City.

Brussels’ global mission is being inserted into well-tested local formats of urban governance that have existed throughout the postwar period. Local powerbrokers continue to form remarkable economic growth coalitions that are successfully manoeuvring through obstacles that would prevent them from cashing in on Brussels’ internationalized economy through property development. Any government strategy that would deal with the rapid internationalization of Brussels and the EU district - socially, economically, culturally or politically - is simply absent. Important segments of Brussels’ social fabric are excluded from participation in public political and cultural life. Meanwhile, the success of extreme right-wing parties - which are fiercely contesting the multiculturalization of Brussels - has risen to alarming levels, while different cultural groups in Brussels are de facto generating hybridized cultural expressions which might form the base of a new modus vivendi of community, citizenship, economy and politics.,Brussels;social exclusion;urban policy;urban regeneration,Research Article
The End of Red Vienna: Recent Ruptures and Continuities in Urban Governance,Frank Moulaert;;;;;Erik Swyngedouw;;;;;Arantxa Rodriguez;;;;;Serena Vicari;;;;;Guy Baeten;;;;;Andreas Novy;;;;;Vanessa Redak;;;;;Johannes Jäger;;;;;Alexander Hamedinger;;;;;Frank Moulaert;;;;;Elodie Salin;;;;;Thomas Werquin;;;;;Arantxa Rodríguez;;;;;Elena Martínez;;;;;Galder Guenaga;;;;;,2001,45,48,After decades of corporatist urban governance dominated by social democracy, Vienna is undergoing a process of economic and political restructuring. This process is expressed physically in large urban development projects, Donau City being the most important. Donau City is a large real estate project on the left bank of the Danube, based on public-private partnership. Due to the liberalization of the housing market, new private actors are increasingly important, influencing decision-making in the Donau City project. In urban planning in general, growing interest in real estate investment has resulted in new planning procedures incorrectly labelled as bottom-up. In fact, this is a fragmented, privatized, opaque and ad hoc form of urban governance accompanied by a new elitist hierarchy formed by leaders of the city’s administration, business and academic worlds. This new, unaccountable elite has elaborated a strategic plan for Vienna with little reference to the citizenry. Therefore, the new liberal form of governance goes hand in hand with important continuities concerning co-optation, exclusion and conflict avoidance. The article ends by stressing the importance of alternative political projects that aim at participatory democracy overcoming deep-rooted authoritarian structures.,local governance;real estate policies;social polarization;urban planning;urban redevelopment,Research Article

To answer this question, the impact of large-scale urban development projects on real estate, housing and job markets is evaluated. It is found that Euralille plays in the first instance an emblematic role in the economic development and social reconstruction of the Lille community. Its impact on socio-economic ‘re-zoning’ of the metropolis is however far from just symbolic. It has set the trend to a new type of corporate estates, it has disturbed the construction cycle of new offices in other parts of the urban region, and it has taken the lead in the creation of a ‘middle-market’ retail system attracting customers from far beyond the Lille agglomeration to its shopping arcades. Moreover, together with other downtown real estate initiatives, it has fuelled the displacement of lower-income housing to cheaper areas of the Metropolis.,Lille;real estate market;social polarization;urban restructuring,Research Article

This concern goes hand in hand with a rediscovery of the central role of cities in the performance of regional and national economies as a whole. But, in a context of radical transformation of production and demand conditions globally, the performance of cities is mediated by their capacity to lead a process of competitive redevelopment. To meet the challenges posed by the changing global competitive climate, the policy agenda of many cities has been drastically reorganized. On the one hand, the search for growth has transformed urban revitalization in one of the main domains of urban intervention. On the other, the new urban policy agenda is singularly framed in a language of competitiveness, improved efficiency, flexibility, entrepreneurship, partnership and collaborative advantage that underwrite the remaking of planning objectives, functions and instruments.,Bilbao;new urban policies;social and spatial polarization;urban renewal,Research Article
Institutional Identities and the Shifting Scales of State Governance in the United Kingdom,Rhys Jones;;;;;Anne E.

The creation of a Scottish Parliament, and Welsh, Northern Irish and London Assemblies, along with the devolution of power to Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) in England, has signalled a substantial territorial refocusing of the scales of political and economic power within the UK state. In this paper, I argue that Storper’s (1997: 268) distinction between institutions - in other words, customary, and sometimes informal rules of practice between groups and individuals - and more formal organizations - which relate to far more programmed and prescriptive political and administrative forms - is useful to study such processes. I suggest that it is imperative for these new bureaucracies of governance, along with their representatives, to undergo an institutional, as well as an organizational, change if they are to become key elements within the British political economy. I contextualize the processes occurring within the contemporary British state by exploring some of the crucial changes which happened during another important period of state restructuring in the United Kingdom, namely the early modern period. In this context, Braddick (1991) has forcefully argued that the centralization of state power which occurred during this earlier period was successful precisely because it also involved a change in informal institutions, as the identities and loyalties of the key bureaucratic officers in the localities gradually became more aligned with the English state. Using some brief vignettes from the contemporary UK state, I suggest that the loyalties and institutional identities of the key officers of state within the new regional bodies - politicians and civil servants, for instance - also need to change if these new organizations are to become truly effective means of governance.,regionalization;social capital;UK,Research Article
Regional Differences in Labour Market Participation of Young People in the European Union,Rhys Jones;;;;;Anne E.

There was a tendency in the 1980s and 1990s for youth transitions to lengthen and become more diverse. It is now the norm for young people to undergo further education/training after the end of compulsory education. As a result, labour market entry has often been delayed, and has become more protracted and complex. Labour market participation is moulded by a number of interrelated factors, including: the demographic and economic context, the organization and structure of the labour market and of education and training systems, the role of the state in shaping labour supply and the organization of the family economy. Using the economic activity rate, together with other measures constructed from the European Labour Force Survey for 1993-7, this paper is concerned with describing, exploring and tentatively explaining labour market participation rates of young people in NUTS 2 regions across the European Union. A range of exploratory data analysis and multivariate regression analysis techniques are employed, and the implications of the findings for understanding current and future regional variations in labour market activity are addressed.,economic activity rate;exploratory data analysis;regional differences;youth transitions,Research Article

After the transition period, two distinct models of economic revival and development emerged in Hungary. One, embodied by Budapest, is that prosperity rests on the tertiary sector. However, industrial output outweighs all other economic indices in regional differentiation in the remainder of the country, as a consequence of the investment strategies of multinational companies. The main factors, agents and impacts on regional differentiation in this non-knowledge-based economic development model are revealed.,Central Europe;core-periphery model;economic transformation;FDIs;new industrialization,Other

In the cluster of county seats, there is a substantial group of innovative, adaptive, information-oriented individuals in their local societies which may facilitate early application of information technologies. Their local economies, particularly the information sector, are also able to adapt to new waves of innovation. Regional policy should concentrate on the most important elements in information transfer, the county seats, in order to build local information sectors into a larger, city network of knowledge centres.,East Central Europe;centres of excellence;innovations;knowledge;regional structure,Other
Winners and Losers in the Transformation of City Centre Retailing in East Central Europe,Rhys Jones;;;;;Anne E.

This paper focuses on the transition of the inner spaces of Czech and Hungarian cities that has been accelerated by large-scale retail investments that formed new foci for retailing, differentiated city centre shopping facilities and changed the frequency, direction and length of shopping trips. In this way, new dimensions of social inequality emerged within cities. The differentiation process rests on the capacity for adaptation to changes in the retail network and shopping behaviour, which correlates strongly with the social status of shoppers. The changes are also put in the context of urban/regional planning which, to date, has not articulated adequate answers to emerging social and land use conflicts.,East Central European consumerism;social differentiation;urban space,Other

The authors argue that the transition period, as a distinctive era, will not bring about fundamental changes in the cause-and-effect relationships of surburban development. The decisive role of capital in Hungarian suburbanization is evident in the uneven development of this spatial process. It is contended that the actors in the suburbanization of transition, although labelled ‘distinctive’ by some commentators, do not have a trajectory which is essentially different from that of their western counterparts. Differences arise from the means and pace of acquiring property and capital. As in advanced capitalism, suburbanization in Hungary results in social tensions, segregation and exclusion.,capital investment;privatization;eal estate market;suburbanization,Other

In addition to problems related to changes in proprietorship, difficulties emerged in the field of production, foreign trade and the institutional system. The difficulties in agriculture also stimulated social tensions and further regional disparities to the disadvantage of agricultural areas. The transitional period has coincided with the EU accession negotiations and preparations for enlargement. After a brief discussion of the general situation and dilemmas in Hungarian agriculture, the paper seeks to summarize the difficulties of the agricultural sector in detail, as revealed during SAPARD (Special Accession Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development) programming at the micro-regional scale in two study areas.,agriculture;EU accession;regional disparities;rural development,Other

It focuses on the role of structural change and infrastructures in this process. First we analyse the convergence of production, labour and productivity among the European Union (EU) regions for the period 1980-96. We then study the impact of structural change in this process. The second part of this article deals with infrastructure, which - since the beginning of the application of EU regional policy - has been one of the main instruments for generating cohesion among EU countries and regions, and was one of the determinants of regional growth and convergence for three periods, namely: 1970-80, 1980-86 and 1988-94. The main findings are: first, that convergence seems to be a complex process, in which structural change is a relevant force; and, second, that infrastructure could be one of the factors that fosters regional growth and convergence.,convergence;European regions;infrastructure,Research Article

Clarke;;;;;David B. Clarke;;;;;,2002,26,5,The concept of welfare regimes has a long pedigree inspired by the work of Gosta Esping-Andersen. This article seeks to examine the exclusionary effects of contrasting systems of welfare as manifested within two of Esping-Andersen’s regime categories, the conservative regime of Germany and the liberal regime of the UK. Using a case-study approach, empirical research has centred on social housing provision in the northern German city of Hamburg and the southern English city of Southampton. These case-studies demonstrate how different regimes produce different variants of social policy despite very similar objectives. The resulting manifestations of exclusion reflect the ideology of the underlying systems as Esping-Andersen’s categories have indicated. The aim of this paper is therefore to examine the manifestations of exclusion as operationalized by contrasting welfare regimes. These exclusionary tendencies are placed within the ideological discourse of citizenship as currently illustrated by the contrasting states, while the continuing relevance of Esping-Andersen’s regime categories are reexamined.,citizenship;exclusion;social housing;social policy;welfare regimes,Research Article

Such variations may be attributable to factors such as the ‘deepening’ of the integration process in the 1980s and the early 1990s and the change in the location strategies of MNEs. Assuming regions as units of analysis with regard to economic integration, this paper provides a first description of where and in which sectors inward FDI is located in Italy, by carrying out a simple analysis at regional level in the period 1985-95. It attempts to shed some light on the characteristic features of Italian regional systems in order to assess their degree of attractiveness for FDI. The geographical distribution of foreign plants in Italy emphasizes the historical imbalances affecting the country, stressing the concentration of FDI in a few advanced regions and the marginalization of the Italian Mezzogiorno. Furthermore, the analysis turns to investigate whether FDI follows regional specialization models by distinguishing between EU and non-EU FDI in sectoral and geographical terms. EU investors turn out to be increasingly related to the sectoral comparative advantages of regional economic systems, while the matching between the specialization of non-EU FDI and that of local firms is relatively less pronounced.,,Research Article
Structure, Strategy and Space: Issues of Progressing Integrated Rural Development in Wales,Simona Iammarino;;;;;Grazia D. Santangelo;;;;;Gillian Bristow;;;;;Moya Kneafsey;;;;;Iain Begg;;;;;Tassilo Herrschel;;;;;Vladimir S. Fateyev;;;;;,2000,39,30,Slow progress towards the integration of rural policies at EU level is encouraging member states to promote strategic and local forms of integrated rural development (IRD) at the point of policy implementation. In the UK, the progressive agenda of devolution coupled with accumulating evidence on spatial trajectories of rural development suggests that it is at the regional level that IRD needs to be fostered. This raises a number of issues for rural regions, concerning how to develop spatially sensitive strategies for IRD and institutional structures conducive to integrated development needs. The purpose of this paper is to explore these issues by focusing on how well the evolving institutional structure in Wales fits the needs of IRD, as exemplified by the objective of developing strong vertical linkages between agricultural production and the food sector. This provides a number of challenges for the new devolved tier of government in Wales, the Assembly, and has a number of wider implications for the progression of IRD across rural regions.,,Research Article
Tourism, Place Identities and Social Relations in the European Rural Periphery,Simona Iammarino;;;;;Grazia D. Santangelo;;;;;Gillian Bristow;;;;;Moya Kneafsey;;;;;Iain Begg;;;;;Tassilo Herrschel;;;;;Vladimir S. Fateyev;;;;;,2000,71,167,Rural areas in many peripheral areas of Europe have turned to tourism as an alternative development strategy in the face of changes to the agricultural food production system. Particularly in more remote and less agriculturally viable areas, national and European-level policies have often concentrated on trying to encourage ‘bottom-up’ development revolving around the commodification of local cultural resources or ‘knowledges’. The extent to which this occurs, however, varies between places. The aim in this article is to use case-study evidence from two peripheral rural locations in Europe to explore why these variations occur. It is argued that the extent to which tourism is adopted or rejected by actors within rural places is determined by the unique configurations of historically layered and newer social relations which intersect within and between such places. These configurations shape the contested ways in which local knowledges are valorized and contribute to the existence of multiple senses of place identity. Qualitative methods, it is suggested, can lead to a more nuanced understanding of the complex ways in which such identities are constructed, and, in turn, to a deeper appreciation of the factors which promote or hinder tourism development at the local level.,,Research Article

Embeddedness and the Tourism Industry in the Polish Southern Uplands: Social Processes as an Explanatory Framework,Ray Riley;;;;;Philip Boland;;;;;Damien Talbot;;;;;Andrew Cumbers;;;;;Eduardo Brito Henriques;;;;;Joachim Thiel;;;;;András Inotai;;;;;,2000,0,9,Accepting that there is a pressing need to place tourism research within a more holistic framework, it is argued that this may be achieved by invoking the notion of embeddedness, which sees enterprises as being shaped by social processes. Four strands are recognized: structural, cultural, cognitive and political. In order further to clarify the complex processes involved, these strands are examined in combination with a structurationist top-down bottom-up approach, and applied to both the supply and demand sides of the tourism industry in the mountainous regions of southern Poland during and after state socialism.,,Research Article

In order to do this, I employ the concept of institutional dynamics, the definition of which is preceded by a distinction between the concepts of institution and organization. I seek to validate this definition by a case-study of the aeronautical branch of Aerospatiale which, over the last 30 years, has undergone a major evolution in the utilization of non-market collective reference points in its subcontracting relationships. These changes are a result, at least partly, of institutional dynamics.,,Research Article
The National State as Mediator of Regional Development Outcomes in a Global Era: A Comparative Analysis from the UK and Norway,Ray Riley;;;;;Philip Boland;;;;;Damien Talbot;;;;;Andrew Cumbers;;;;;Eduardo Brito Henriques;;;;;Joachim Thiel;;;;;András Inotai;;;;;,2000,84,24,In recent years, commentators have downplayed the role of the national state in shaping regional economic development. In particular it has been argued that globalization processes are undermining the national level as a container of economic regulation and action. This has been accompanied by a celebration of the regional level as a site for constructing competitive advantage, amid growing evidence of increased sub-national economic agglomeration. This article contests this view, arguing that in the current era the state remains a key actor in both mediating the effects of global economic integration and shaping the trajectories of regional economies. The argument is illustrated through a comparative analysis of oil-based regional economic developments in the UK and Norway. The case studies highlight the contrasting role played by the national state in the two countries and the varied spatial outcomes and prospects that arise as a result.,,Research Article
The Cultural Economy of Cities: A Comparative Study of the Audiovisual Sector in Hamburg and Lisbon,Ray Riley;;;;;Philip Boland;;;;;Damien Talbot;;;;;Andrew Cumbers;;;;;Eduardo Brito Henriques;;;;;Joachim Thiel;;;;;András Inotai;;;;;,2000,45,14,This article examines the role that big cities play in an ongoing change towards a ‘global cultural economy’. Starting from Allen Scott’s argument that a handful of urban flagships may benefit from this shift, it looks for an alternative approach to the territorial dimension of the ‘culture-economy nexus’ based on a more complex understanding of urban culture. A broad theoretical discussion of Scott’s ideas, as well as on the key concepts of culture, economy and the city, is placed alongside two case studies of the development of the audiovisual (AV) media sector in two European metropolitan regions, Hamburg and Lisbon. The article concludes that the territorial dimension of the ‘culture-economy nexus’ is more than the mere concentration of culturally informed economic activity in a few urban ‘master hubs’. Rather, it can be characterized as a non-linear refracted shift, to a large extent moving along historically and culturally determined trajectories of cities and regions.,,Research Article

Williams;;;;;Jan Windebank;;;;;John Pløger;;;;;David Gibbs;;;;;Rainer Dombois;;;;;Guenter Warsewa;;;;;,2001,110,441,During the 1990s competing images emerged of what constitutes European identity, who belongs to it, and what are its internal and external boundaries. This has forced reflection on the links between state territoriality, and territorialities occurring on and between other spatial scales. This paper analyses images of Europe, narratives on European identity, and how these images have implied different forms and conceptualizations of spatiality. Europe is understood as an experience, a structural body and an institution. Structural interpretations have traditionally been dominant, but now an institutional-bureaucratic view has taken a dominant position in defining what Europe is. Growing flows of refugees and immigrants call into question the state-centred identities and narratives of nationally bounded cultures. In the current situation a more cosmopolitan view is needed instead of the established, exclusive concept of place. The paper suggests that this can be done by understanding place as a cumulative archive of personal experience that is not bound with some specific location. Regions, for their part, may be understood as collective institutional structures. A challenge for research is to reflect how regions and places come together and what kind of spatial imaginaries and ideologies are involved in this process.,European Union;identity;place;region;state,Research Article
How Many Europes?: The European Union, Eastward Enlargement and Uneven Development,David Sadler;;;;;Anssi Paasi;;;;;John Agnew;;;;;Nicky Gregson;;;;;Roger Bivand;;;;;Joe Painter;;;;;Canan Balkir;;;;;Colin C. Williams;;;;;Jan Windebank;;;;;John Pløger;;;;;David Gibbs;;;;;Rainer Dombois;;;;;Guenter Warsewa;;;;;,2001,42,133,Eastward enlargement of the European Union (EU) is rarely discussed in terms of the organizational and ideological condition of the existing Union. In this paper the debate over eastern enlargement is related directly to a shift within the EU from a dual focus on global economic competitiveness and the compensation of lagging regions to an increasingly singular focus on European competitiveness. Seen in this light, the goal of a single Europe with relatively similar levels of development everywhere is being replaced by an emerging threefold division of the continent into a ‘core’ Europe (itself increasingly differentiated across policy areas), a ‘peripheral’ Europe of potential eastern members perpetually on the road to full membership, and an ‘external’ Europe excluded from membership but open to use by businesses from the core. This geographical taxonomy rests on the growing reliance of the EU on a neo-liberal economic ideology that sees uneven development within Europe as helping the global competitiveness of the EU as a whole, using the model of the United States as its inspiration.,eastern enlargement;European Union;neo-liberalism;uneven development,Research Article

Few studies exist on the impact of media representations and on the differential way in which many of the latter portray east and west Germans, while even less attention has been paid to people’s own interpretations and their capacity to negotiate between media representations and other social experiences in the process of identity formation.,cultural studies;Germany;post-socialist geographies;unification,Research Article
An Institutionalist Approach to Local Restructuring: The Case of Four Norwegian Mining Towns,Britt Dale;;;;;;Arthur Benz;;;;;;Dietrich Fürst;;;;;;Mirosława Czerny;;;;;;Daniela Szymańska;;;;;Andrzej Matczak;;;;;;Justyna Weltrowska;;;;;;Benicjusz Głębocki;;;;;;Henryk Rogacki;;;;;;Mirosława Czerny;;;;;;Andrzej Czerny;;;;;;,2002,46,68,Much of the inspiration of the ‘contextual turn’ in economic geography and regional development studies comes from institutional economics, and its focus on economic life as both an instituted process and a socially embedded activity. The concept of institution has been used in a variety of ways, however. Often the concept is defined in a broad and all-inclusive manner, or it is just stated that institutions are important, without discussing the content of the concept in any depth. The aim of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the concept of institutions and the relevance of an institutionalist approach in studies of local and regional development. It starts with a brief overview of the various schools of institutional theorists and the controversies and divergence among them. I argue for the value of a broad conception of institutions, which includes cognitive constructions and normative rules as well as regulative structures. The theoretical discussion is exemplified by a presentation of how an institutionalist approach can be utilized as an analytical framework in a study of the restructuring of four small Norwegian mining communities. The study identifies several types of institutions that in various ways have influenced the process of restructuring and its outcome. These institutions are operating at different geographical levels and reflect regulative constraints, normative obligations and expectations, as well as cognitive classifications and identities. A better insight into the functioning of these institutions will enhance our understanding of the capabilities, problems and prospects of this kind of community.,contextual geography;institutional theory;restructuring,Research Article

It aims to identify favourable conditions for policy learning in regions. Supported by the most prominent theories on regional development and innovation, the existence of autonomous policy networks in regions is regarded as a fundamental prerequisite for generating innovations. However, previous research does not clarify how networks have to be organized and linked to the institutional framework inside and outside a region, how actors should interact in networks, and whether competitive or cooperative orientations of actors are more conducive to change. Our theoretical reasoning leads us to the conclusion that learning regions are those that manage to meet different, to a certain degree contradictory, demands regarding structures of networks and actors involved. Successful learning, the generation and implementation of new patterns of politics and new policies depends on specific structural characteristics of networks, but also on actors’ cognitive dispositions, orientations, strategies and interactions. Moreover, favourable institutional settings are identified which may induce adequate network structures and support innovative policies. Finally we draw some conclusions for practical regional policy in a ‘learning region’.,actor-centred institutionalism;network theory;regional governance,Research Article

It also set in train economic and social processes that have provided a new basis for the Polish economy, and brought about changes in standards of living, and access to goods and services. Social polarization has been one of the basic expressions of these spatial-temporal variations. The author considers the factors responsible for the divergence in living standards, identifies the main tendencies inherent in polarization, and provides a synthesis of the mechanisms of increasing social differences in an economy undergoing transformation.,new middle class;social mobility;spatial polarization,Other

The present regional economic ranking is not simply a reproduction of the positions held under central planning. There are even cases of strong inversion in the rankings. Older traditions of enterprise and participation in higher education have proved stronger factors in development than the level of investment inherited from state socialism. The authors explore the different strands of agricultural transformation, and of industrial change, which is even more spatially diversified, and more open to the impact of internationalization. They emphasize the links between regions and foreign markets, a relationship which has been neglected by most researchers.,agriculture;economic development;foreign trade;industry;Poland,Other

Regional planners have viewed the eastern part of the country as a peripheral region, and the recent systemic transformation of the national economy has emphasized the weakness of a regional structure that was shaped under central planning. However, in common with the rest of the country, eastern Poland has also experienced changes attesting to its adaptability to new socio-economic conditions. Intra-regional centres of gravity have been redefined and they have been more dynamic than the region as a whole. With this in mind, the present study considers the economic and social transformations in the last decade in nine selected towns.,cities;peripheral regions;Poland;transformation,Other

In Search of a European Edge Urban Identity: Trans-European Networking among Edge Urban Municipalities,Irina van Aalst;;;;;Inez Boogaarts;;;;;N. A. Phelps;;;;;D. McNeill;;;;;N.

New funding streams for policy development and implementation have emerged with the Commission’s financing of trans-European local authority networks. In this paper we consider the formation of a shared European identity and the nature and content of interauthority networking activities, drawing upon the example of one newly formed network - the edge cities network. Here we make use of original empirical material drawn from three case-study edge city municipalities - Croydon, Getafe and Noisy-le-Grand. We find that a weak form of shared European edge urban identity has developed to date, and that the direct and indirect benefits of networking are not all that they might be. There is some evidence that longstanding national traditions of interorganizational working and administrative arrangements have exerted an influence on the networking activities of at least one of these edge urban municipalities. In this respect, transnational networking meshes with aspects of local entrepreneurial coalition building which are often imbued with a sense of interlocality competition for private and public investment.,economic development;edge cities;entrepreneurialism;policy networks;urban politics,Research Article

The main aim of the paper is to draw policy lessons from theoretical analysis and international comparison. After a short analysis of the debate about the literature on local development (industrial districts, endogenous development, regional innovation systems), the paper deals with the concept of ‘local productive system’, determined by a strict interaction between economy, society and territory. Local productive systems, through productive linkages and interaction among local actors, produce external economies (to local firms) and collective efficiency. Success stories of local development are based on the production of specific knowledge and resources, on collective learning. The creation of dynamic competitive advantages is, then, the crucial factor for a sustainable local development. It is possible to argue that a ‘high road to development’, based on quality products and innovation, is the pathway for local and regional development in Europe. Finally, policy lessons for depressed regions are drawn.,bottom-up strategies;collective efficiency;endogenous development;external economies;industrial district;interregional cooperation;local competitive advantages;local productive system,Research Article
Spatializing Quality: Regional Protection and the Alternative Geography of Food,Irina van Aalst;;;;;Inez Boogaarts;;;;;N. A. Phelps;;;;;D. McNeill;;;;;N. Parsons;;;;;Gioacchino Garofoli;;;;;Nicholas Parrott;;;;;Natasha Wilson;;;;;Jonathan Murdoch;;;;;George Blazyca;;;;;Krystian Heffner;;;;;Ewa Helińska-Hughes;;;;;,2002,104,379,The globalization of trade in foodstuffs is now a firmly established feature on the landscape of economic geography, although its impacts and desirability remain the source of controversy. Yet, while the liberalization of trade in food continues apace we are simultaneously witnessing a reassertion of foods with local and regional identities. This ‘counter-trend’ has led some economic and agricultural geographers to propose that an ‘alternative geography of food’ may be coming into view. If this contention is correct, it would seem to be implicated in new forms of food governance, notably European legislation that has provided legal protection to designated regional foods, through the ‘PDO’ and ‘PGI’ labels. In this paper we explore the background to the development of these protective devices, which, we argue, illustrates profound differences between ‘northern’ and ‘southern’ food cultures and agricultural systems within Europe. In stylized terms, we argue that the former places great emphasis on ‘efficient’ production of commodities while the latter retains strong affiliations to ‘terroir’, tradition and artisanal production. Analysis of the spatial distribution of registered regional foodstuffs reflects this north-south divide, with more than 75 percent of the products registered in five southern EU states (France, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Spain). Our analysis, which compares the two ‘cultures of food’ using conventions theory, shows that spatial differentiation also exists at a regional level and that a similar proportion of PDO products originates from Less Favoured Areas (LFAs). This implies that the new geography of ‘alternative’ foods is becoming increasingly complex. We explore the obstacles and opportunities, arising within the two distinct food cultures of ‘north’ and ‘south’.,alternative geography of food;conventions;Europe;PDOs;quality,Research Article
Poland - Can Regional Policy Meet the Challenge of Regional Problems?,Irina van Aalst;;;;;Inez Boogaarts;;;;;N. A. Phelps;;;;;D. McNeill;;;;;N. Parsons;;;;;Gioacchino Garofoli;;;;;Nicholas Parrott;;;;;Natasha Wilson;;;;;Jonathan Murdoch;;;;;George Blazyca;;;;;Krystian Heffner;;;;;Ewa Helińska-Hughes;;;;;,2002,58,33,In the first rush of postcommunist transformation there was little governmental enthusiasm in Poland for anything as ‘activist’ as regional policy. But in 1999, after almost 10 years of neglect, regional policy received a fresh impetus with reforms to decentralize state administration. With over two years’ experience of the new system it is becoming possible to identify some of the major issues and challenges facing Polish regional policy as the political elite makes final preparations for EU entry. With that accession in mind we draw, in this paper, on a largely Polish discussion of regional problems and policy to tease out and comment on some of the pressing regional development issues for the period ahead. After reviewing some of the traditional fault lines in Polish economic space we trace the evolution of regional policy leading to the decentralizing reforms of 1999. Early experience of the new system suggests that policy developments, particularly those connected with capacity to shape and implement regional policy, lag behind institutional changes. The gap between policy and institutions underpins the danger that weaker regions - especially, in Poland’s case, in the east of the country - may not be able to reap EU membership advantages to the same extent as stronger and better prepared regions. The fear that EU entry will exacerbate regional differences should not be too readily dismissed.,capacity-building;decentralization;EU enlargement;Poland;post-communism;uneven development,Other
Writing (Across) Europe: On Writing Spaces and Writing Practices,Nicky A Gregson;;;;;Kirsten Simonsen;;;;;Dina Vaiou;;;;;Jamie Gough;;;;;Hubert Heinelt;;;;;Margit Mayer;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;Stephen Syrett;;;;;Robert Baldock;;,2003,0,59,In this paper we explore how existing, loosely geographical, English-language journals constitute Europe within their writing/publishing spaces. Focusing on two sets of journals - British/British-North American and those which are explicitly (pro) European in their orientation/content - we show how some of these journals appear to write contemporary Europe out of their spaces, casting Europe instead through the homogenizing lens of 19th-century colonialism. By contrast, others make more or less space for contemporary Europe but construe this as a transparent space; to be written about and framed by distant, dislocated commentator-viewers, whose power to comment and frame is regulated by their location within specific European geographical communities. Correspondingly, we argue that these journal spaces are both constituted through a centre-margin imaginary and constitutive of this power-geometry. This situation is argued to reflect academic working practices that are largely national or within-culture rather than cross-culture, and to reproduce dominant (Northern/Western) representations of Europe. In the final section of the paper, drawing on some of our own experiences, we consider how cross-cultural writing practices have the potential to disrupt this power geometry.,Europe;journals;power geometries;writing practices;writing space/s,Other
The Genesis and Tensions of the English Regional Development Agencies: Class Relations and Scale,Nicky A Gregson;;;;;Kirsten Simonsen;;;;;Dina Vaiou;;;;;Jamie Gough;;;;;Hubert Heinelt;;;;;Margit Mayer;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;Stephen Syrett;;;;;Robert Baldock;;;;;,2003,0,19,This paper argues that the origin of the recently founded Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) in England should be theorized in terms of the class relations and tensions of economic regulation in Britain and the use of scale and rescaling to manage those tensions. The paper considers the class logic of neo-liberalism, which has been particularly strongly developed in Britain due to its long-standing liberal settlement, and the problems of socialization of production which neo-liberalism has produced. The class tensions and problems of socialization which first created, and then led to the decline of, centrally-redistributive regional policy are discussed. Analogous processes at the EU level are examined. A key precursor of the RDAs, local economic initiatives, is examined, and the spatial-class relations underlying them discussed. These arguments are then the basis for understanding the partial rescaling of regulation in England downwards from the national state and upwards from the local level, and also the shift from centrally to locally controlled regional policy. This analysis of origins of the RDAs then suggests a number of tensions in the project which will shape its future trajectory; due to these tensions the class relations of the new regional economic governance remain open.,class relations;economic governance;England;Regional Development Agencies;regionalization;rescaling,Other
Local Politics Research in Germany: Developments and Characteristics in Comparative Perspective,Nicky A Gregson;;;;;Kirsten Simonsen;;;;;Dina Vaiou;;;;;Jamie Gough;;;;;Hubert Heinelt;;;;;Margit Mayer;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;Stephen Syrett;;;;;Robert Baldock;;;;;,2003,0,0,This article summarizes the development and peculiarities of research in urban politics in Germany. It is focused on the working group on Local Politics Research (Arbeitskreis Lokale Politikforschung/LoPoFo) within the German Political Science Association as the core of the scholarly debate in this country for nearly 30 years. The article consists of three parts. Part one highlights the paradigms of local politics research in Germany and its main distinctions from other disciplinary approaches in analysing urban topics - not at least sociology. The second part gives an overview of the different thematic orientations of the discussion since the 1970s. This leads to the third part in which strengths and weaknesses of local politics research in Germany are compared with the situation in other countries (especially the Anglo-Saxon world). It can be perceived as a strength that local politics research has been in many respects a front-runner in the disciplinary debate of political science in Germany. This is the result of the fact that most scholars engaged in local politics research do not act as 'urbanists' but as 'generalists', looking for urban topics as tokens of more general phenomena. However, this aspect reflects also a crucial weakness. There is not continuity in the debate, and a common understanding of theories and methodologies of research in local politics is missing. Last but not least, weaknesses and strengths are expressed in the structures of German universities where local politics is not institutionalized through curricula or job descriptions, as in the Anglo-Saxon world.,Germany;local politics research,Other
European Integration and New Forms of Uneven Development: But Not the End of Territorially Distinctive Capitalisms in Europe,Nicky A Gregson;;;;;Kirsten Simonsen;;;;;Dina Vaiou;;;;;Jamie Gough;;;;;Hubert Heinelt;;;;;Margit Mayer;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;Stephen Syrett;;;;;Robert Baldock;;;;;,2003,0,59,Historically, capitalism developed territorially specific forms in Europe. The project of the European Union can be seen as one that seeks to erode this specificity. There is evidence of a tendency towards regulatory convergence but also of counter-tendencies, partly a product of the contradictory character of EU expansion and deepening economic integration. The end product has been a multiscalar system of governance and regulation, conjoining the EU, national and sub-national scales. There is also some evidence of convergence in national economic structures and performance. However, there is no evidence of convergence in economic performance and structures at sub-national levels. The legacies of past uneven development, allied to the effects of intensified market competition as companies seek to exploit differences between places, have produced new forms of uneven development.,expansion of the European Union;European integration;multiscalar governance and regulation;territorially specific capitalisms;uneven development,Other
Reshaping London's Economic Governance: The Role of the London Development Agency,Nicky A Gregson;;;;;Kirsten Simonsen;;;;;Dina Vaiou;;;;;Jamie Gough;;;;;Hubert Heinelt;;;;;Margit Mayer;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;Stephen Syrett;;;;;Robert Baldock;;;;;,2003,0,12,The shift towards network forms of urban and regional governance operating in a multi-level manner across different spatial scales and sectors is now well observed. For London, the system of network governance that developed from the 1980s appeared poorly positioned to respond to the particular challenges faced by world cities of retaining international competitiveness and dealing with increased social polarization. The restoration of pan-London strategic governance in 2000 initiated a phase of intense evolution in economic governance as the result of the creation of a Mayor and associated agency, the London Development Agency (LDA), to take the lead role for economic development and regeneration activity in the capital. This article analyses the emerging governance arrangements within London to illustrate the evolutionary and path-dependent nature of change through the interaction of national political and constitutional contexts, local conditions and wider processes of global change. The article argues that the potential of reinvigorated city-level economic governance within London is heavily constrained by the manner in which power was devolved by the central state. In its attempts to provide a strategic, lead role for London's economic development, the Mayor and the LDA must operate within a network governance system characterized by strong central control and a reliance on a complex array of partners operating across scales and sectors to deliver its economic strategy.,institutional change;London Development Agency;London governance;network governance;new regionalism,Other

It does so through examining cities and regions as moments in webs of connections and through considering the diversity of economic practices that constitute regional economic life. Drawing inspiration from non-essentialist political economy, the paper charts several debates over how European regions are conceived in the mainstream, and emphasizes the limits of seeing regional spaces as bounded, centred on capitalist social relations and fixed in their identities. The paper explores alternative readings that emphasize the relational and open nature of regional spaces through a consideration of the economic practices found in the European garment industry.,clothing industry;diverse economy;Eastern Europe;regions;space,Other
International Labour Mobility and Uneven Regional Development in Europe: Human Capital, Knowledge and Entrepreneurship,David Sadler;;;;;Allan Williams;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;Adrian Smith;;;;;Allan M.

Three underlying themes run through the paper. First, the role of social networks in mediating relationships between flows and spaces. Second, the recomposition of the spatiality and temporality of flows in response to Europeanization and globalization, evident especially in the emergence of increased but differentiated skilled labour mobility. And, third, the locking into space - however temporarily - of inherently ‘sticky’ flows of labour mobility. These themes are investigated through an exploration of how the human capital, knowledge and financial capital embedded in migrants are created and articulated by migrants’ local and trans-local relationships in their spaces of origin and destination. Finally, the paper reflects on some of the ways in which the intersection of migration flows and spaces mediate patterns of uneven regional development in Europe.,human capital;knowledge;migration;mobility;regions;remittances,Other

This paper examines the regional effects of FDI in Central Europe (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) in the 1990s. It challenges uncritical views of FDI and its role in regional economic transformations by considering its potentially adverse effects for regional economic development, such as the intensification of uneven development, the development of a dual economy, failure to develop linkages with local and regional economies, and its contribution to increased regional economic instability. A case-study of the Czech automotive components industry illustrates the regional economic effects of FDI in Central Europe in terms of stability of investment, its links with the regional economy and its effects on domestic research and development.,automobile industry;Central Europe;Czech Republic;foreign direct investment;regional development;research and development,Other

In transition economies and in Russia in particular, both the quality of data and their comparability are subject to criticism. This phenomenon is particularly observable for the Kaliningrad region, which is currently at the centre of discussions between the European Union and the Russian Federation. At present, many observers and policy makers are dissatisfied with the existing figures. The objective of this paper is to fill part of the gap and to give an economic image of the Russian enclave, on the basis of five years of fieldwork. We concentrate on the assessment of Kaliningrad’s trading openness and its economic development level. In a first section, we reassess the trading position of the region taking into account its geographical location. Second, we give an appraisal of the unrecorded economy of the enclave and reassess regional production. Finally, we make Gross Regional Product comparable with other countries and reassess the region’s GRP in purchasing power parity.,Baltic region;exclare;Kaliningrad;purchasing power standard;Russia;unrecorded activities,Other
Spatial Impacts of Post-Socialist Industrial Transformation in the Major Hungarian Cities,David Sadler;;;;;Allan Williams;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;Adrian Smith;;;;;Allan M.

The main objectives of this study are to reveal the most important similarities and differences in the spatial impacts of post-socialist industrial transformation on the major Hungarian cities (Budapest, Debrecen, Gyór, Miskolc, Pécs and Szeged). The capital city and other major cities display divergent development trends owing to the changes in the post-socialist industrial space and landscape.,Hungary;industrial transformation;urban land use,Other
Segregation and Residential Mobility: Spatially Entrapped Social Mobility and Its Impact on Segregation in Athens,Thomas Maloutas;;;;;Bernard Deacon;;;;;Egil Stræte;;;;;Mark C. White;;;;;Paula Ferreira;;;;;Isabel Soares;;;;;Madalena Araújo;;;;;Carmen Echebarria;;;;;Jose M.

This paper explores first the origins of this unilateral attention and ultimately relates it to the context in which mobility, and residential mobility in particular, were conceptualized by the founders of Urban Sociology.The rest of the paper is an attempt to substantiate the context dependency of this relation through the examination of the social mobility of long-term residents and its impact on shaping local social profiles in Athens. The Athenian context, bearing important similarities to those of other large cities in Southern Europe and elsewhere, has been characterized both by comparatively reduced residential mobility and by increased social mobility in the process of rapid postwar urbanization and the massive conversion of rural masses to urban dwellers. The importance of spatially endogenous social mobility is discussed in particular with respect to social structures and institutions – such as the family or the housing system – that have been systematically impeding residential mobility. The conclusion is that the social mobility of the longterm residents has a varying, context-dependent importance for the analysis of segregation patterns and tendencies which in many cases is unwittingly neglected.,Athens;long-term residents;residential mobility;segregation;social mobility,Research Article
Under Construction: Culture and Regional Formation in South-West England,Thomas Maloutas;;;;;Bernard Deacon;;;;;Egil Stræte;;;;;Mark C. White;;;;;Paula Ferreira;;;;;Isabel Soares;;;;;Madalena Araújo;;;;;Carmen Echebarria;;;;;Jose M. Barrutia;;;;;Itziar Aguado;;;;;Luiza Bialasiewicz;;;;;,2004,57,34,New regionalist writings display a growing tendency to turn towards the role of institutions and culture in the formation of regions. However, the way these are articulated is less than clear. This article calls for a re-combination of culture and institutions in order to analyse the process of regional formation at a micro-level. To do this it employs the concepts of discourse and the everyday to investigate the cultural reproduction of the region in the peak institutions of the new regionalization in the South West of England. In the absence of widespread regional identities in England, such institutions play a major role in constructing and policing the meaning of ‘region’. Interview data help to unpack an evolving regional discourse in south-west England, one that involves the everyday reproduction of representations of the region in the new regional institutions. Underlying this discourse of the region lie some traditional and stereotypical images of the South West. Furthermore, the implications of this reconfiguration of scale are explored in relation to another territorial identity at a lower scale, with reference to the campaign for a Cornish Assembly. The article concludes that the power of regional elites to create regions is overstated by the new regionalism.,Cornwall;culture;institutions;region;scale,Research Article
Innovation and Changing ‘Worlds of Production’: Case-Studies of Norwegian Dairies,Thomas Maloutas;;;;;Bernard Deacon;;;;;Egil Stræte;;;;;Mark C. White;;;;;Paula Ferreira;;;;;Isabel Soares;;;;;Madalena Araújo;;;;;Carmen Echebarria;;;;;Jose M. Barrutia;;;;;Itziar Aguado;;;;;Luiza Bialasiewicz;;;;;,2004,48,38,Restructuring within the agro-food supply chain has given rise to a debate about how to maintain the creation of local added value. Innovation is one of the main strategies proposed as a part of the quality ‘turn’ in agro-food. The purpose of this paper is to identify and discuss problems and important factors in the processes of product development. Three Norwegian case-studies of dairies, which have tried to develop new dairy products, constitute the empirical basis.They are all local firms within a larger cooperative company. Even though there are similarities in the context for these three cases, there are differences in how their strategies are carried out. The theoretical framework is based on the theory of conventions and the theory of worlds of production. It is concluded that important factors for innovation and change of worlds of production are local entrepreneurial capabilities, intensity of integration between firm and parent-company, and the strength of the firm’s embeddedness to the local community. Entrepreneurs are important as agents who break old conventions; intensity of vertical integration may be a constraint for change of world of production; and strong local embeddedness is an advantage for innovation within the quality ‘turn’ in agro-food. It is an advantage to be strong on entrepreneurial capabilities, but there are possibilities of substitution. Local entrepreneurial capabilities can be substituted by mobilizing vertically in business integration; however, this substitution may constrain a more radical innovation.,conventions;dairy;food supply chain;innovation;worlds of production,Research Article
Inward Investment, Firm Embeddedness and Place: An Assessment of Ireland’s Multinational Software Sector,Thomas Maloutas;;;;;Bernard Deacon;;;;;Egil Stræte;;;;;Mark C. White;;;;;Paula Ferreira;;;;;Isabel Soares;;;;;Madalena Araújo;;;;;Carmen Echebarria;;;;;Jose M. Barrutia;;;;;Itziar Aguado;;;;;Luiza Bialasiewicz;;;;;,2004,88,64,This paper examines the embeddedness of multinational software firms located in the Republic of Ireland. Over the past 15 years, Ireland has emerged as a software centre of growing importance. Many leading US companies now use Ireland as a platform from which to service the European market, in turn making Ireland the world’s leading software exporter. As a result, the extent to which software multinationals become embedded within Ireland will affect future economic development. Although subject to several interpretations, the conceptualization of embeddedness offered in this paper incorporates traditional concerns with local linkages between multinational corporations and host regions as well as issues of growing interest such as affiliate evolution and expansion. In addition, it considers the wider business environment’s influence on firm embeddedness. The findings are based on published data and corporate and government interviews conducted during field research in Ireland. The paper finds that over time software multinationals are becoming somewhat more embedded within Ireland, but several issues related to the negative externalities of Dublin’s rapid growth potentially hinder future development.,embeddedness;foreign direct investment;Republic of Ireland;software,Research Article

It is still protected and monopolistic while most other European countries have already liberalized, at least partially, their natural gas markets. This paper focuses on the process of restructuring the energy market in the European Union, and the present situation in Portugal, and emphasizes the regional dimension of the Portuguese market. The natural gas price strategies followed by Portuguese companies are analysed, and a comparison with those of liberalized Europe is attempted. Special attention is given to the United Kingdom, as an example of a completely liberalized market, and also to Spain due to its close links to the Portuguese energy sector. From the results obtained, possible future scenarios for Portugal in a liberalization context are presented.,liberalization;natural gas;price policy,Other

From a consensus of this nature both an important flow of scientific production and a significant degree of real implementation might be expected. However, a review of the literature and a real case-study (Spain) lead us to conclude that although increasing effort is being made in both fields, there is still a long way to go.,environmental policy;Local Agenda 21;local government;Spain;sustainable development,Other
Corporate Repeat Investment and Regional Institutional Capacity: The Case of After-Care Services in Wales,Crispian Fuller;;;;;;Nola Hewitt-Dundas;;;;;Bernadette Andréosso-O’Callaghan;;;;;Mike Crone;;;;;Stephen Roper;;;;;;Frank Moulaert;;;;;;Jacques Nussbaumer;;;;;,2005,0,15,This paper examines the role of after-care services in the corporate ‘repeat-investment’ process at foreign-owned establishments (FOEs) in Wales - a region of the UK which has attracted a significant number of inward investors. With the growing importance of repeat investment in peripheral regions, development agencies increasingly seek to support foreign production establishments with ‘after-care services’, such as supply-chain initiatives and lobbying corporate HQs. In this paper the corporate processes that influence the role and importance of regional after-care services are examined. Building upon an understanding of multinational enterprises as differentiated entities, the analysis centres on the repeat-investment process at two FOEs where after-care was important, and two FOEs where it was irrelevant. A heterogeneous range of corporate processes which are mostly beyond the authority of FOEs are found to influence the importance of after-care services. Such processes are related to the wider corporate context in which production establishments operate, suggesting that regions are being tied into important scalar processes of institutionalization with corporate processes functioning at much broader socio-spatial scales. This raises important questions about the extent to which regions can influence corporate processes, given their multi-scalar nature, and suggests that there should be greater emphasis on the broader political economy in which regions are embedded, one aspect of which is the (asymmetrical) power relations between regional development agencies and multinational enterprises.,after-care services;corporations;regions;repeat investment,Research Article
Knowledge Transfers from Multinational Plants in Ireland: A Cross-Border Comparison of Supply-Chain Linkages,Crispian Fuller;;;;;Nola Hewitt-Dundas;;;;;Bernadette Andréosso-O’Callaghan;;;;;Mike Crone;;;;;Stephen Roper;;;;;Frank Moulaert;;;;;Jacques Nussbaumer;;;;;Henning Nuissl;;;;;Adrian Smith;;;;;John Pickles;;;;;Robert Begg;;;;;Poli Roukova;;;;;Milan Buček;;;;;Harriet Bulkeley;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;,2005,62,14,For regions or nations which historically have had low levels of domestic R&D investment - such as Ireland, North and South - inward investment represents a potentially important source of inward knowledge transfer. Using data from large multinational plants throughout Ireland, this paper examines the geography of knowledge within Irish manufacturing, focusing particularly on knowledge gaps and knowledge-transfer activity. The analysis suggests three main empirical results. First, no significant knowledge gaps exist between the Irish plants of multinational enterprises (MNEs) and international best practice. Second, larger knowledge gaps exist between MNE plants and their best local suppliers, suggesting the potential for local learning in the supply chain. Average knowledge gaps to suppliers also tend to be larger in the North. Third, there is no clear evidence that knowledge-transfer activity is more intensive where knowledge gaps are widest. In particular, developmental interaction between MNE plants and suppliers tends to be more common in the South. Our results suggest the potential benefit of policy measures both to increase knowledge-transfer activity along the supply chain and also to increase knowledge-transfer activity between companies which are not trading partners.,Ireland;knowledge;multinational;supply chain,Research Article

Innovation and related economic and social categories have been at the centre of policy discussions on the future of the European economy and society. Reflections on the innovative and learning region (Territorial Innovation Models; TIMs) have underpinned regional and local development policies. Yet dissatisfaction with the technologist and market-competition-led development concept of the TIMs is growing and today its shortcomings are well known. But to formulate an alternative based on a different ontology requires a multidimensional reflection on the pillars of territorial development. The first section briefly refers to the critical evaluations of the literature on regional innovation and the so-called Territorial Innovation Models. The second section returns to basic questions about the meaning of regional economic development and innovation. It puts forward community development based on social innovation as an alternative to market-led territorial development. The third section examines the consequences of the community ontology for the definition of a number of basic concepts. Categories such as capital, knowledge, learning, evolution, culture and so on receive a different meaning in a model where the economic is only one dimension of the overall dynamics of community development. The fourth section integrates the role of power relations and the articulation between various spatial scales and institutional settings into the community-development approach. The final section dwells on the consequences of this community-oriented territorial approach for contemporary research agendas on local and regional development policies and strategies.,community-based development;regional policy;social innovation,Research Article
Trust in a ‘Post-Socialist Region’: A Study of East German ICT Entrepreneurs’ Willingness to Trust Each Other,Crispian Fuller;;;;;Nola Hewitt-Dundas;;;;;Bernadette Andréosso-O’Callaghan;;;;;Mike Crone;;;;;Stephen Roper;;;;;Frank Moulaert;;;;;Jacques Nussbaumer;;;;;Henning Nuissl;;;;;Adrian Smith;;;;;John Pickles;;;;;Robert Begg;;;;;Poli Roukova;;;;;Milan Buček;;;;;Harriet Bulkeley;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;,2005,66,16,As trust is essential for close mutual cooperation, trust between entrepreneurs running SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) has been increasingly acknowledged as an important factor in regional economic development. However, one of the main problems of post-socialist economies is that the increased need for entrepreneurial trust is thwarted by conditions discouraging the creation of trust. In order to investigate this problem, an empirical study was carried out among ICT entrepreneurs in eastern Germany to examine the main aspects of trust identified in the recent literature on SMEs and entrepreneurship. The findings revealed that although barriers impeding the emergence of inter-entrepreneurial trust do not necessarily exist in a lagging, transforming region such as eastern Germany, its development may prove more difficult than elsewhere. Problems can be attributed to ‘legacies of socialism’ in the knowledge patterns of ‘post-socialist entrepreneurs’ and, more importantly, their perception of a general lack of market power. However, actual problems of building entrepreneurial trust can usually be resolved by careful reflection on the part of those concerned.,qualitative content analysis;SME cooperation;trust,Research Article

This paper provides a set of reflections on the European Commission’s recent Communication on the future of the industry in Europe in the light of pressures of liberalization, globalization and EU enlargement. Based upon ongoing research on the restructuring of the Central and East European clothing sector, the paper highlights the limits of the outward-processing model of production that has dominated east-west interactions in this sector. It also examines the uneven role of upgrading and emerging design capacity in the industry, the role and limits of clothing-industry clusters in the new member states, and considers the role of ‘countermarkets’ in the pan-European clothing-contracting system.,clothing industry;East-Central Europe;EU enlargement;outward processing,Other

The article aims to study regional restructuration as a case of general economic transformation in an evolutionary economics perspective.

In order to remediate the difficulties of empirical studies and to allow for a more structured comparison of different frame-works, the article outlines and applies a ‘research tool’ to the specific issue of regional restructuration. While such a tool is not a framework, it is intended to more readily compare different theories and frameworks with empirical studies.,biotechnology;evolutionary studies;ICT;methodology;regional restructuration,Research Article

They may, however, also result in stagnation and decline. For clusters in many of the fast developing technologies, the evolution is closely related to shifts in technological life-cycles. During the 1980s and 1990s new mobile communications technologies have emerged as a series of distinct life-cycles, which have caused major disruptions in the industry. The paper examines the key features of a cluster in wireless communications technologies, where the economic evolution has been quite closely related to the emergence of new key technologies. The analysis is focused on the strategy and policy issues involved in the specific phase where one technological life-cycle may (or may not?) be succeeded by the next. When facing disruption the actors in the cluster have discussed various strategies for how to cope with shifts in the technological life-cycles. We find that there is room and need for policy and collective action in periods of uncertainty created by new disruptive technological life-cycles.,communication technology;regional clusters;technological life-cycles,Research Article
Are Industrial Districts Formed by Networks Without Technologies?: The Diffusion of Internet Applications in Three Italian Clusters,Mark Lorenzen;;;;;Magnus Holmén;;;;;Maureen McKelvey;;;;;Bent Dalum;;;;;Christian Ø.R. Pedersen;;;;;Gert Villumsen;;;;;Fiorenza Belussi;;;;;Elisa Giuliani;;;;;Deborah Tappi;;;;;Willem G.M. Salet;;;;;James Wadwell;;;;;Colin C. Williams;;;;;,2005,66,28,It is widely acknowledged that there has been a technological revolution in information and communication technologies (ICT), centred on Internet applications, in recent years. However, there is still a great controversy about the extent to which ICT are transforming the competitiveness of individual firms, clusters and large economic regions. On the one hand, the use of ICT could undermine those economic systems that are very distant from the strategic motors where these developments are taking place, re-establishing a re-centralization pattern in both functional (size) and geographical (space) dimensions. On the other hand, the ‘virtualization’ of the spatial economic relations could offer economic agents located in peripheral areas a better access to the development of distance relationships. In this perspective, the assumptions of the ‘vanishing’ of physical distance could represent a fascinating ‘utopia’. This paper analyses how industrial districts (IDs), which may be considered special forms of clusters, have managed the absorption of ICT (information and communication technologies). Are they formed by networks without technologies? In order to answer this question we organized an empirical research in three selected Italian clusters. We chose three cases which are representative of the empirical variation. The investigation presented here is based on a selected sample of 42 firms interviewed (all SMEs). Their behaviours in terms of ICT technology adoption were found to be quite similar in the three IDs studied. We reached the conclusion that neither size nor the entrepreneurial cognitive frame matters in hindering diffusion. Our results seem to demonstrate that firms adopted ICT technologies with respect to end customers while they were reluctant to use B2B linkages with subcontractors and suppliers (EDI and ERP technologies). However, this should not be interpreted as a lock-in phenomenon, but as a sign that they rely on flexible and trustful informal communication that cannot easily and efficiently be virtualized in electronic form.,clusters;ICT technologies;industrial districts;innovation;learning;local systems,Research Article
Cluster Absorptive Capacity: Why do Some Clusters Forge Ahead and Others Lag Behind?,Mark Lorenzen;;;;;Magnus Holmén;;;;;Maureen McKelvey;;;;;Bent Dalum;;;;;Christian Ø.R.

It argues that the dynamic growth of a cluster depends on its absorptive capacity and therefore on the capacity of firms to absorb external knowledge and diffuse it into the intra-cluster knowledge system. This article speculates on the relationship existing between the heterogeneity of firms’ knowledge bases with both intra- and extra-cluster knowledge systems. It concludes by illustrating that a conceptual link exists between firm-level knowledge bases, the cluster absorptive capacity and its potential for growth.,absorptive capacity;firm knowledge base;industrial clusters,Research Article
Clusters, Adaptation and Extroversion: A Cognitive and Entrepreneurial Analysis of the Marche Music Cluster,Mark Lorenzen;;;;;Magnus Holmén;;;;;Maureen McKelvey;;;;;Bent Dalum;;;;;Christian Ø.R. Pedersen;;;;;Gert Villumsen;;;;;Fiorenza Belussi;;;;;Elisa Giuliani;;;;;Deborah Tappi;;;;;Willem G.M. Salet;;;;;James Wadwell;;;;;Colin C. Williams;;;;;,2005,73,38,Over recent decades, clusters like industrial districts have increasingly attracted attention in economic debate. The study of clusters, particularly in the Italian literature, highlights the inadequacy of the mainstream body of explanation to provide a theory of the emergence and transformation over time of these clusters. Evolutionary theory seems to provide an adequate framework for the study of clusters. The paper applies an evolutionary perspective to the study of clusters by analysing an empirical case-study on the accordion cluster of Marche (Italy). The study of development of this cluster as an evolutionary self-organizing process will be proposed. The main concern of the paper is to highlight how the cluster analysed undertook the structural transformation which led its production from a very traditional style of manufacture to a technologically intensive one. The focus will be on the degree of continuity and complementarity between the capabilities, skills and knowledge accumulated or the trajectory exploited within the cluster over time and the new trajectory explored. By doing so, the paper analyses a particular transformation phase of the cluster under observation, that is the phase which led the cluster to a transformation in the composition of its production activity. Across this phase the paper identifies some key actors whose presence affected the possibility for the cluster to undertake the transformation. The relevance of these actors is related to their role within the internal production chain as well as to their external networking.,cluster;entrepreneurship;knowledge;network,Research Article

Berlin is the (and often literally the building) site on which a new Germany is being constructed. The making up of the new Berlin is dominated by attempts to reinterpret and reimagine its history: it is a city of memorials and of deliberate absences; of remembering and forgetting, or trying to forget; of reshaping the past as well as trying to build a new future. The juxtapositions of urban experience, the layering of memories and the attempt to imagine a different future come together to define Berlin as a contemporary capital city.,Berlin;globalization;capital cities;memory and meaning;normalization and nation,Research Article
Business Systems and Cluster Policies in the Basque Country and Catalonia (1990–2004),Allan Cochrane;;;;;Manu Ahedo Santisteban;;;;;Luis César Herrero;;;;;José Ángel Sanz;;;;;María Devesa;;;;;Ana Bedate;;;;;María José del Barrio;;;;;Lois Labrianidis;;;;;Brikena Kazazi;;;;;Donald McNeill;;;;;Fiona M. Smith;;;;;Donald McNeill;;;;;Alan Latham;;;;;Neil Brenner;;;;;Pertti Joenniemi;;;;;,2006,36,19,The governments of the Basque Country and Catalonia in Spain, the most industrialized regions in Spain and the most active in demanding political selfgovernment, were among the first to develop industrial cluster policies. The concrete application and further evolution of these policies have been rather different. The main reason for this has been the particular social structures and dynamics of their respective regional industrial-business systems, composed of distinctive socio-business communities, industrial groupings, and industry associative systems. In the Basque case, the main policy result has been the constitution of 11 cluster-associations of the whole Basque Autonomous Community as long-term and broad public–private cooperation arrangements at industry level. In the Catalan case, the policy has resulted mainly in short-term and specific collaborative processes at local cluster or district level. Despite these differences, both cases of cluster policies exemplify the construction of ‘government–industry’ collaboration at the subnational-state regional level, within the emerging decentralized socio-institutional system in the Spanish industrial economy.,cluster policies;industrialbusiness systems;regional government–industry collaboration,Research Article
The Economic Impact of Cultural Events: A Case-Study of Salamanca 2002, European Capital of Culture,Allan Cochrane;;;;;Manu Ahedo Santisteban;;;;;Luis César Herrero;;;;;José Ángel Sanz;;;;;María Devesa;;;;;Ana Bedate;;;;;María José del Barrio;;;;;Lois Labrianidis;;;;;Brikena Kazazi;;;;;Donald McNeill;;;;;Fiona M. Smith;;;;;Donald McNeill;;;;;Alan Latham;;;;;Neil Brenner;;;;;Pertti Joenniemi;;;;;,2006,50,151,The artistic and cultural activities have not only a key cultural and social value, but also an undeniable economic impact. Indeed, it is a fact that the cultural sector represents a productive branch which is growing in importance. The cultural factor is frequently used as a key element for regional and/or economic development. In this vein, this article aims to estimate the economic impact of Salamanca 2002 as the European Capital of Culture, using the methodology provided by the impact studies in two stages: first, through estimating private spending generated by the event's cultural tourism; and second, through calculating the overall economic impact, including the private spending on cultural consumption, public spending directly related to the cultural programme, investment in new equipment and facilities, along with the estimate of the multiplying effects on the overall regional and national economies.,cultural economics;economic development;models of economic impact;multiplying effects,Research Article
Albanian Return-migrants from Greece and Italy: Their Impact upon Spatial Disparities within Albania,Allan Cochrane;;;;;Manu Ahedo Santisteban;;;;;Luis César Herrero;;;;;José Ángel Sanz;;;;;María Devesa;;;;;Ana Bedate;;;;;María José del Barrio;;;;;Lois Labrianidis;;;;;Brikena Kazazi;;;;;Donald McNeill;;;;;Fiona M. Smith;;;;;Donald McNeill;;;;;Alan Latham;;;;;Neil Brenner;;;;;Pertti Joenniemi;;;;;,2006,39,52,The paper focuses on two of the most important challenges that contemporary Albania has to face: emigration, which has divested the country of about one-fifth of its population, and internal migration, resulting in unprecedented spatial disparities devastating most of the country, particularly rural areas, and substantially increasing the population of Tirana and to a lesser extent Durres.This paper specifically addresses the issue of how emigration and internal migration are interrelated; in particular, whether returning Albanian emigrants from the principal destination countries (i.e. Greece and Italy) exacerbate spatial disparities. The paper is based on the empirical findings of a questionnaire survey of 324 respondents conducted in Albania in early 2002 as well as more recent fieldwork conducted in 2004 with more qualitative questionnaires addressed to 39 recent migrants to Tirana. Our empirical findings support the idea that return migration does not exacerbate recently increased spatial disparities within the country, thus placing a further burden on the development trajectory of the country. At most, one might argue that returning migrants, bringing back money with them or having sent back remittances beforehand, may facilitate an ongoing process of internal migration stemming from more fundamental causes such as a search for more job and business opportunities and a better quality of life.,Albania;emigration;internal migration;return migration;spatial disparities,Research Article

Place and the Geography of Italian Export Performance,Michael E.

Delladetsima;;;;;Henry Shaftoe;;;;;Murat Ali Dulupçu;;;;;Michael Woods;;;;;Craig Johnstone;;;;;,2006,74,21,Studies of contemporary economic development within industrialized societies often focus upon the local scale of analysis. From the positive externalities linked with agglomeration to the role which local institutions can play in altering regional economic trajectories, there is a tendency within economic geography to ‘go local’. Though there is much to be gleaned from local, firm-based research, the fact that the local is situated within other spatial scales, and in many cases is contingent upon broader geographical contexts (e.g. regional, national, global) is sometimes understated. We expand the geographical frames of reference by which Italian economic development, and in particular understandings of local growth in Italy, are understood, by situating the local in Italy within other meso-scale relationships.Though certain areas and regions of Italy are famous for their particular brand of local economic development, these places are not isolated nor are they independent in a geographic sense.Through detailed spatial analyses of provincial export shares, which are used to gauge the external basis of a local economy, we show that understanding and explaining economic growth in Italy and elsewhere can benefit from an approach which appreciates the significance of extra-local linkages.,export performance;Italy;local growth;spatial analysis,Research Article
Mobile Networks and Place Making in Cultural Tourism: Staging Viking Ships and Rock Music in Roskilde,Michael E.

Delladetsima;;;;;Henry Shaftoe;;;;;Murat Ali Dulupçu;;;;;Michael Woods;;;;;Craig Johnstone;;;;;,2006,52,58,Tourism has become an increasingly important asset for small and medium-sized cities. However, tourism is a vulnerable basis for the local economy of towns and cities as it depends on far-reaching, mobile and unstable networks of visitors, cultural industries and attractions, local authorities, voluntary associations, buildings, objects and so forth directing flows of people, money, information and images. These networks produce new cultural economies and policies, contingently committed to the projects of producing ‘tourist places’. This article challenges conventional understandings of territorial learning by comparing two cases of cultural tourism and their spin-off developments in Roskilde, Denmark: first the Viking Ship Museum, its development into a ‘Museum Island’ in the harbour area during the 1990s and its project ‘Return of the Viking Longship'; second, the Roskilde Festival with its still not fully developed projects ‘Musicon Valley’ and ‘Rock City’. We emphasize the role of local authorities and of international connections. In so doing we attempt to bridge the gap between contemporary discussions of tourism and cultural economy in cultural and economic geography, and ask how these attractions, events and projects have emerged and how the dynamics producing tourist places are organized in time and space.,cultural economy;cultural tourism;networks;place;rock music;Vikings,Research Article
Do Business Investment Incentives Promote Employment in Declining Areas? Evidence from EU Objective-2 Regions,Michael E. Shin;;;;;John Agnew;;;;;Sébastien Breau;;;;;Paul Richardson;;;;;Jørgen Ole Bærenholdt;;;;;Michael Haldrup;;;;;Daniele Bondonio;;;;;Robert T. Greenbaum;;;;;P. M. Delladetsima;;;;;Henry Shaftoe;;;;;Murat Ali Dulupçu;;;;;Michael Woods;;;;;Craig Johnstone;;;;;,2006,40,44,To help address the large regional disparities in income that stubbornly persist across Europe, billions of euros have been invested in business investment incentives cofunded through the European Regional Development Fund. Since 1989, these incentives have been spatially targeted through various Structural Funds aimed at promoting economic and social cohesion among all European Union countries. ‘Objective 2’ of the Structural Funds aims to help revitalize those areas with persistently high unemployment and declining industrial production. Despite the continued popularity of these initiatives, no reliable ex-post empirical evidence of their impact is yet available to help EU policymakers refine future geographicallytargeted economic development policies. To begin to address the void, this article uses unique firm-specific data available for northern and central Italy to estimate a parametric difference in difference model that calculates the employment impact of the ‘Objective 2’ area business incentives net of all changes due to economic trends that are exogenous to the programme intervention. Mean impact results show that the incentives did promote positive employment growth in the target areas that would not have otherwise occurred. The analysis further finds that the incentives were most effective when targeting production in province–industry pairs that had the least severe declines during the years prior to the programme intervention.,employment policy;impact evaluation;structural funds;urban and regional economic development,Research Article
The Emerging Property Development Pattern in Greece and its Impact on Spatial Development,Michael E. Shin;;;;;John Agnew;;;;;Sébastien Breau;;;;;Paul Richardson;;;;;Jørgen Ole Bærenholdt;;;;;Michael Haldrup;;;;;Daniele Bondonio;;;;;Robert T. Greenbaum;;;;;P. M. Delladetsima;;;;;Henry Shaftoe;;;;;Murat Ali Dulupçu;;;;;Michael Woods;;;;;Craig Johnstone;;;;;,2006,66,115,Real estate market and property development dynamics in Greece are undergoing some critical changes, exhibiting a new condition which governs the relationship between capital and landed property in the current phase of capitalist development. A key feature of these changes is the formation of a property development pattern which clearly marks a break with the dominant conventional one (structured upon the small-scale owner occupation and the absence of big capital). The potential impact of this new pattern is difficult to assess as yet. Each pattern – the conventional and the newly emerging one – are affecting spatial development differently (in positive or negative terms). As things stand, however, there does appear to be a contradictory coexistence between the two; this is aggravated by inability of state and planning policy, in particular, to actively intervene in the changing spatial economy and society. Thus, there seems to be an inherent risk in the near future of having to cope only with the negative features produced by the two patterns which in a worstcase scenario could result in: continuous urban sprawl, non-planning and environmental degradation, increases in land values, overborrowing, reduction of public space and other socio-economic, functional and environmental bottlenecks.,Greece;impacts;property patterns;spatial development,Research Article

To do so, we introduce three examples of'alternative' local and regional development activities in Europe: (a) social economy projects to tackle problems of localized social inequalities and local development; (b) public sector procurement and related intiatives to create healthier diets; and (c) participatory municipal budgets as a means to make radical participatory democracy a practical proposition. We discuss the issues that arise from them in terms of a radical local and regional development strategy and how they help to re-formulate our theoretical agendas and research practice. Unlike many uncritical studies of `successful' places that then seek mechanistically to transplant the bases of `success' as `off the shelf ' blueprints to be applied in and to other places we instead see these examples as providing an alternative framework for thinking about local and regional development that adapts more general principles (such as those of equity, accountability and democracy) to the specifics and local and regioanl circumstances.,Radical political practice;progressive local and regional development;neo-liberal globalisation;Europe;social economy;public procurement;health and diet;participatory democracy,Research Article
Knowledge Collaboration and Proximity: The Spatial Organization of Biotech Innovation Projects,Costis Hadjimichalis;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;Jerker Moodysson;;;;;Ola Jonsson;;;;;Petr Pavlínek;;;;;Luboš Janák;;;;;Mario Polèse;;;;;Fernando Rubiera-Morollón;;;;;Richard Shearmur;;;;;Óscar Fernández;;;;;Guy Baeten;;;;;Jill Fenton;;;;;,2007,57,191,This article addresses the role of proximity for knowledge collaboration between dedicated biotechnology firms (DBFs) and related actors. Innovation projects managed by a selection of eight Swedish DBFs are analysed in detail and classified with regard to their specific knowledge characteristics. Based on this classification, explanations to the relative importance of functional and relational proximity to collaborators are sought.The findings indicate that knowledge collaboration in projects characterized by embodied knowledge are more sensitive to functional proximity than projects characterized by embrained and encoded knowledge. The findings also indicate that even though functional proximity is facilitative, global knowledge collaboration is indispensable for most DBFs. The convenience of local collaboration can never replace the extreme requirements of specialized knowledge, which forces them to seek collaborators on a global arena despite the impediments they face in these situations. Policy resources aimed at promoting bioregions are therefore better used to enhance local resources and to provide conditions for DBFs to link up with global sources of knowledge rather than to boost the formation of `second best' local networks.,biotechnology;innovation;knowledge;projects;proximity,Research Article

We investigate the tiered structure of the Škoda suppliers in Czechia by classifying 232 Czech-based Škoda suppliers in three distinct tiers and comparing the differences in the distribution between the foreign-owned and domestic suppliers in these tiers.We explore the changes in the spatial distribution of the Škoda suppliers in Czechia since the beginning of the post-socialist economic transformation in the early 1990s, which are linked to the tiering of the supplier base and to the differences among the individual tiers in the type of the supplied components and in the timing of component deliveries. Both the processes of concentration and dispersion are identified.We then analyse the relationships between the location of the Škoda suppliers within Czechia and their basic characteristics such as their size, ownership, age and position in the supplier tier. Based on the results we consider the geographic differences in the regional development potential of the Škoda supplier network in Czechia.,automotive components industry;Czechia;location;regional development;Škoda supplier network;tiers,Research Article

It argues that welcome though this interest may be, the narrowness of its focus says much about the limitations of current Anglophone urban and regional studies. Following on from the recent set of Euro-commentaries in this journal, and using recent writing on Berlin as a case-study, it suggests Anglophone urban studies has much to gain from: (a) placing greater value on the plurality of Europe's urban tradition; and (b) paying greater attention to the plurality of urban narratives that lie outside the existing analytic consensus within Anglophone urban and regional studies.,,Research Article

The Geography of Gross Employment Flows in British Manufacturing,Allan Williams;;;;;David Sadler;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;Jürgen Essletzbichler;;;;;Michael Dunford;;;;;Lidia Greco;;;;;Mel Evans;;;;;Stephen Syrett;;;;;Alexander Kaufmann;;;;;Alistair Shepherd;;;;;Frances Fahy;;;;;Alex Jeffrey;;;;;,2007,61,25,This article offers a first attempt to examine subnational differences in the determinants of gross employment flows in the British manufacturing sector utilizing the Annual Respondents Dataset (ARD) of the Office of National Statistics. The article has four broad aims. First, it examines how the job creation and destruction process in British manufacturing compares with the processes in other countries. Second, it examines how much job creation and destruction is the result of employment shifts from declining industries and post-code areas to growing industries and areas relative to employment turnover that occurs among plants within industries and areas.The results indicate that high rates of job creation and destruction occur simultaneously in contracting as well as expanding industries and areas, suggesting that differences in net employment change can only be considered as a first step to understanding employment turnover. Third, the article investigates differences in the driving forces of job creation and destruction for British postcode areas and uncovers pronounced variation in the forces generating and destroying employment. Fourth, the article examines how much of these subnational differences can be attributed to industrial structure and reveals that industry-mix accounts for a large part of employment turnover in postcode areas.The large variation in the driving forces of job creation and destruction leads to important consequences for employment policy.Policies which focus too narrowly on new-firm start-ups and small firms are likely to be insufficient in generating employment in all areas.,Annual Respondents Database (ARD);British manufacturing;job creation;job destruction,Research Article
Geographies of Growth, Decline and Restructuring: The Rise and Fall (Privatization) of the State-Owned Steel Sector and the Trajectories of Steel Localities in the Italian Mezzogiorno,Allan Williams;;;;;David Sadler;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;Jürgen Essletzbichler;;;;;Michael Dunford;;;;;Lidia Greco;;;;;Mel Evans;;;;;Stephen Syrett;;;;;Alexander Kaufmann;;;;;Alistair Shepherd;;;;;Frances Fahy;;;;;Alex Jeffrey;;;;;,2007,37,27,This article deals with the recent evolution of the Italian steel industry and of steel-making activities in two localities in the Mezzogiorno. After providing an account of the rise and fall of the public steel sector in Italy and its role in shifting the industry’s centre of gravity to the South, it concentrates on a conceptually informed discussion of the remarkable rise of northern mini-mill operations and the subsequent acquisition by a few of these companies of the privatized public enterprises in the 1990s. Most attention is paid to two of the leading new companies (Lucchini and Riva) and to the trajectories of some of their steel-making activities in two localities in Basilicata and Apulia. The trajectories of these companies and localized steelmaking activities are themselves explained in the light of the resources and strategies of corporate actors and the context in which these actors operate. Actors’ strategies are driven by a quest for profits and a struggle to accumulate in the face of competition from rival producers, and are examined in relation to the economics of steel production in the Italian South, the processes of workforce recomposition in Taranto and the tensions between profitability and environmental protection. The context includes cyclical and secular trends in the consumption and production of steel, some of the aid and restructuring actions of the ECSC, some of the specific characteristics of accumulation and competition in the steel sector and the legacies of earlier phases of local development that helped shape actors’ strategies.,commodity and value chains;geographical economics;Italy;Lucchini;Mezzogiorno;mini-mills;profit and accumulation strategies;Riva;state holding companies;steel industry restructuring upgrading,Research Article
Generating Social Capital?: The Social Economy and Local Economic Development,Allan Williams;;;;;David Sadler;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;Jürgen Essletzbichler;;;;;Michael Dunford;;;;;Lidia Greco;;;;;Mel Evans;;;;;Stephen Syrett;;;;;Alexander Kaufmann;;;;;Alistair Shepherd;;;;;Frances Fahy;;;;;Alex Jeffrey;;;;;,2007,81,139,In seeking to understand and promote long-term and inclusive models of local economic development the notion of social capital appears potentially important. In the development of the social economy, an aspect of the local economy which has attracted an increased theoretical and policy focus in recent years, the relationship with social capital appears particularly significant.Yet despite the apparent salience of notions of social capital, there remains a lack of understanding of the nature and extent of existing social capital resources and the precise manner in which these are drawn upon in the development of the social economy to generate further social capital within the local development process. In part this is a result of the conceptual confusion surrounding the notion of social capital, but it also reflects a lack of empirical research. This article explores the notion of social capital and the manner in which it is produced, reproduced and used locally within the social economy as part of the local economic development process. Findings are presented from a transnational European research project which examined the development of social enterprises and the social economy within different localities in order to seek to better understand their interrelationships with the local production and use of social capital.These findings emphasize the importance of contextualization in the study of local social capital and the importance of interpretative approaches for area-based policy development.,local development;social capital;social economy;social enterprise,Research Article
Euro-Commentary: The Role of Urban RTI Policy in Stimulating Innovation in the Local Economy: The Case of the City of Vienna,Allan Williams;;;;;David Sadler;;;;;Ray Hudson;;;;;Jürgen Essletzbichler;;;;;Michael Dunford;;;;;Lidia Greco;;;;;Mel Evans;;;;;Stephen Syrett;;;;;Alexander Kaufmann;;;;;Alistair Shepherd;;;;;Frances Fahy;;;;;Alex Jeffrey;;;;;,2007,30,2,Innovation networks have been analysed at several spatial levels, from the local to the global, with increasing interest in innovation systems below the national level.A wide range of regions has been studied including cities as major centres of innovation. But there is often a difference between the importance of a city as a location of innovation activities and to what extent they can be influenced by politics and public institutions at the city level.This commentary focuses on Vienna, the capital of Austria. Analysing the innovation networks of firms located in Vienna shows the potential scope and limits of the city’s influence on innovation relations. Data from an innovation survey of the Viennese economy lead to the conclusion that only a minor share of the innovation relations of local firms can be influenced directly by the city’s institutions. The results give some indication of where and how the city could be able to increase its influence on the innovation activities of the local economy, reducing Vienna’s dependence on Austria’s federal research, technology and innovation policy.,innovation network;innovation policy;Vienna,Research Article

First, it compares neo-liberal and social innovation discourses about urban socio-economic change, including associated policies and key agencies. Second, it seeks to improve the analytical framework of urban development by combining `spatialized' Regulation Theory with elements from Cultural Political Economy and from Urban Regime Theory.Third, with the help of case-studies, the article illustrates how social innovation is a potentially powerful concept, capable of anchoring urban change movements more firmly into the local social and political fabric. The case-studies, some of which are included in this special issue, analyse examples of social innovation in a number of European urban contexts, within the framework of the FP5 SINGOCOM research project.,path dependency;regulation;social innovation;urban regimes,Introduction
Radical Innovation in the Era of Liberal Governance: The Case of Vienna,Frank Moulaert;;;;;Flavia Martinelli;;;;;Sara González;;;;;Erik Swyngedouw;;;;;Andreas Novy;;;;;Elisabeth Hammer;;;;;Pasquale De Muro;;;;;Paola Di Martino;;;;;Lucia Cavola;;;;;Etienne Christiaens;;;;;Frank Moulaert;;;;;Bie Bosmans;;;;;Andrea Membretti;;;;;,2007,0,44,This article exploits the potential and limits of participation as a means to overcome authoritarian structures. The main argument is that social innovation at the grassroots level can only become radical if it helps overcome authoritarianism which is a general characteristic of capitalist societies and has a specific form in Austria and Vienna. The two projects chosen for in-depth analysis are initiatives of bottom-up participation: Local Agenda 21 and Local Area Management. Both are deeply interwoven with current processes of transformation in Europe, oscillating between path dependency — surrendering to one more episode of controlled modernization — and radical change — the diffusion of a political culture of democracy and participation. The initiatives analysed focus on a common political domain: broadening public participation by offering better access to the local state and the public sphere. Both projects put in train broad discussions of how to organize social change and mobilization. They are Janus-faced as there were struggles between democratic tendencies, which seek to acknowledge a wide range of stakeholders in policy making, and techno-corporate tendencies. Both projects are `schools of participation', as they increased know-how and social competence and raised consciousness. But only by questioning liberal governance and the straitjacket of its naturalization of the market society can citizens regain control of urban development and jointly shape the destiny of the city.,Local Agenda 21;participatory politics;social innovation;urban democracy,Research Article

It then considers how European citizenship might be theorized in geographical terms, before turning specifically to the relationship between European citizenship and regionality. Drawing on the case-study research, this relationship is examined through four themes: identity, political rights, social rights and civic engagement. The article concludes with a commentary on the implications of a regional perspective for the future development of European citizenship.,Catalonia;European citizenship;regional identity;regionalism;Scotland;Upper Silesia;Veneto,Research Article

Gomez;;;;;Costis Hadjimichalis;;;;;Bernard Deacon;;;;;,2008,0,46,Since the 1990s the `region' has been widely acknowledged as an appropriate arena for innovation policies. While regional innovation policies and the creation of regional innovation systems and local clusters are highly propagated by the European Union and the OECD, there are still significant differences in regional activities even among nation states which are equally exposed to global competition, and are similarly dependent on technological innovations, such as Sweden, Switzerland and the Netherlands. The article aims to explain this variation in regional innovation policies by arguing that a country-specific pattern consisting of the geographical concentration of the science and research system, the vertical fragmentation of the political system, the degree of Europeanization, and the endowments of the regions shapes the way innovation policies are pursued in the regions.,Europeanization;Netherlands;policy performance;regional innovation policies;regionalization;Sweden;Switzerland,Research Article
The Socialist Past and Postsocialist Urban Identity in Central and Eastern Europe: The Case of Łódź, Poland,Joe Painter;;;;;Rupert Waters;;;;;Helen Lawton Smith;;;;;Heiko Prange;;;;;Craig Young;;;;;Sylvia Kaczmarek;;;;;Luiza Bialasiewicz;;;;;Jean-Baptiste Harguindeguy;;;;;Georgina M. Gomez;;;;;Costis Hadjimichalis;;;;;Bernard Deacon;;;;;,2008,0,160,Cities in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) are creating new urban identities under conditions of postsocialist transformation, Europeanization and globalization. Discourses about postsocialist urban identity frequently attempt to `Europeanize' these cities' identity and to obscure elements of the `unwanted past', particularly the socialist, Soviet and Russian pasts. However, those pasts can return to disrupt dominant narratives of postsocialist urban identity. This article analyses how the past of socialism and relationships with Russia and the Soviet Union are treated in the construction of new urban identities in postsocialist CEE, particularly in the case of Łódź, Poland. After outlining the treatment of the socialist past in Polish society and politics, the article analyses the contested construction of a new identity for Łódź. The analysis focuses on the construction of a past multicultural `European' `Golden Age' for the city to create a new identity for it, and how that identity is contested and disrupted by the re-emergence of the city's socialist past and the history of its relations with Russia and the Soviet Union.The article concludes by outlining the broader implications of the case-study for the understanding of postsocialist urban identity formation.,Łódź;Poland;postsocialism;socialist past;urban identity,Research Article

Gomez;;;;;Costis Hadjimichalis;;;;;Bernard Deacon;;;;;,2008,0,54,Recent representations of the European project have, more often than not, characterized it as `uncertain',`weak',and even `indeterminate'. In this article, I look to the political — and geopolitical — ramifications of such understandings, in particular as regards Europe's role in the world. I remark, especially, on the geographical imaginations which underpin such critiques: highly normative assumptions regarding political territoriality and `power' in the international arena. I argue that such geographical imaginations fundamentally miss the radical transformations taking shape at and well beyond Europe's borders, thus failing to recognize the emergence of the EU as a very new sort of international actor.,Europe;geopolitics;international intervention;power;territoriality,Research Article

Coronado;;;;;Stuart Dawley;;;;;;Alison Stenning;;;;;Andy Pike;;;;;,2008,45,106,Many cross-border regions in Europe remain more political dreamscapes than examples of strong transnational integration.The development of the Öresund region through a bridge linking Copenhagen and eastern Denmark with Southern Sweden has been seen as a model for EU region building. Drawing on a multidisciplinary project, this article uses the Öresund case as a starting point, bringing in some contrastive Scandinavian examples. The aim is to discuss how regions try to make themselves visible and attractive for investments and visitors, but above all to what extent they produce regionauts actively creating integration by different border-crossing activities and contacts. The focus is on the cultural dimensions found in everyday practices and symbolic manifestations of these transnational processes. What kind of gaps between regional rhetoric and actual mundane activities emerge? A historical perspective is used to illustrate these changing border dynamics in which cultural, political and economic asymmetries often become an energizing factor.,cross-border regions;cultural dynamics;everyday life;national identity;Öresund,Research Article

Coronado;;;;;Stuart Dawley;;;;;Alison Stenning;;;;;Andy Pike;;;;;,2008,0,45,Different forms of regional politics and network-type coordination are present within European cross-border initiatives. The purpose of the article is to study the changing organizational configurations of interregional governance in the context of the Helsinki—Tallinn Euregio (HTE), and how these new forms of coordination influence cross-border institutional capacity and policy outcomes.The basic empirical material consists of official public documents and eight semi-structured theme interviews conducted with the key actors of the HTE in June—July 2004. `Governance capacity' is used here as a theoretical tool to understand and interpret the reorganization process of cross-border governance. The case-study about the HTE shows the possibility that governance may be practised through dynamic social networks and partly shifting territorial configurations according to interregional interests. The HTE agency creates a flexible intervention frame for the cross-border governance capacity to support regional competitiveness through the policy instruments of the European Union.There are already some results, but several challenges remain for the HTE to create additional scale effects between the Helsinki and Tallinn regions.,cross-border governance;governance capacity;Helsinki;Tallinn Euregio,Research Article

Coronado;;;;;Stuart Dawley;;;;;Alison Stenning;;;;;Andy Pike;;;;;,2008,0,34,Social capital is often defined as consisting of trust and postmaterialist values on the one hand, and social networks on the other hand. This article examines how different governance modes such as networks, markets, and hierarchies are related to trust and postmaterialist values in 74 West German regions.A principle component analysis of 40 social capital indicators shows that trust and postmaterialist values do not solely combine with networks but also with preferences for markets and hierarchies. A cluster analysis identifies two dominant types of regional social capital in West German regions. These types are different from the well-known Italian patterns described by Robert Putnam in his seminal work. In the period 1995—2002, the annual economic growth in regions which have combined trust with preferences for strong markets and weak political networks was on average 1 percent higher than in regions with inverted preferences.,hierarchies;markets;networks;regional governance;social capital,Research Article

Mapping Corporations, Connecting Communities: Remaking Steel Geographies in Northern England and Southern Poland,Orvar Löfgren;;;;;Tarmo Pikner;;;;;Lorenz Blume;;;;;Detlef Sack;;;;;Maddi Garmendia;;;;;José M. de Ureña;;;;;Cecilia Ribalaygua;;;;;Jesús Leal;;;;;José M. Coronado;;;;;Stuart Dawley;;;;;Alison Stenning;;;;;Andy Pike;;;;;,2008,116,33,In recent years, economic geographers have turned their attention to the growing geographical reach and complexity of economic networks to focus on the increasing integration of economies, the geographical organization of economic activity and the social, economic and political relationships within these networks.Within this work, particular attention has been paid to the corporation, allowing for corporate geographies to be rethought using new approaches and new methodologies. Building on these approaches, we seek to develop a holistic economic geography which embeds the globalizing corporation within a broad array of economic, social, political and cultural settings shaped by multiple social agents.We do this in the context of the European steel industry. We argue that refocusing attention on the steel industry is important for two reasons. First, the industry itself has radically changed in the last decade. Persistent global overcapacity and cycles of profitability, ongoing consolidation and privatization, the emergence of new steel regions and of more `globalized' steel producers have all altered the industry's anatomy. Second, the tools of economic geography have changed. New approaches enable us to look again at the steel industry and to rethink its corporate geographies. This article develops these arguments by using an innovative approach, integrating the narratives of two steel corporations and two European steel regions, and focusing on issues of corporate geography, financialization, government and governance, labour and community. In this way, we seek to continue the strong tradition within economic geography of conceptualizing the spatial contexts and consequences of economic change through accounts of the continuous remaking of steel geographies.,communities;corporations;globalization;northern England;restructuring;southern Poland;steel industry,Research Article

Its first section examines the hypothesis that the shift to modular production offers a chance to modify value chain geography inasmuch as modularity causes new opportunities and constraints in geographic proximity terms. An analytical matrix is provided and applied to New Accession Countries, with special consideration being given to French suppliers' circumstances due to the requirement that host country characteristics and company specificities be analysed simultaneously. The second section tests this matrix using statistical data and culminates in a case-study. It will be demonstrated that New Accession Countries are being integrated with the rest of the Continent, due to firms' ongoing search for location-related advantages and because of a tightening/easing interaction that is associated with proximity constraints.,automotive;division of labour;modular production;New Accession Countries;suppliers,Research Article

Coe;;;;;Jennifer Johns;;;;;Kevin Ward;;;;;Dilek Özdemir;;;;;James Darby;;;;;Manuel González-López;;;;;,2009,0,102,The article deals with the impact of the emerging new division of labour between Western and Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) on work and employment, both in the Western and CEE countries. Major points of discussion will be the hypothesis of a `hollowingout' of the Western European auto industry, and the hypothesis of a `regime flight'; that is, the claim that companies use CEE locations to escape the collectively regulated work models of Western Europe. The article draws from our own empirical research, including company case-studies in Western and Eastern auto plants, and on statistical analysis. The main conclusions are: in CEE countries, an upgrading process of production sites can be observed, which challenges the view of an emerging `high end/low end' division of labour between the West and the East.While relocation has led to some losses of low-skill jobs in Western Europe, the overall effect of the expansion of the automotive industry to CEE on growth and employment in Western Europe was positive.The impact of low-cost component imports from CEE countries has increased the competitiveness of the German firms, which are by far the main investor in CEE countries. Our case-studies reveal no trend towards regime flight from Western European work models, but management threats of relocation have become commonplace and have led to a renegotiation of work models in Western European countries. In CEE countries, the work models of automobile companies more and more are oriented at a high-road path.This development is fostered by the companies' responses to the problems of migration and the increasing shortage of skilled labour.,automotive industry;Central and Eastern Europe;division of labour;relocation;work models,Research Article

We review post-1990 production trends and the associated changes in the geography of automobile production in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) based on inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI).To evaluate industrial upgrading, we examine the changes in the international trade of CE countries with automotive products classified in three value-added classes between 1996 and 2006, and we consider the increasing location of automotive design in CE by foreign investors.We classify CE automobile assembly plants into four types based upon the role of local design, local content, and their links with domestic economies. Based on the results of the analysis, we consider the effects of FDI and industrial upgrading on the role of CE in the European automotive production system.,automotive industry;Central Europe;foreign direct investment;industrial upgrading,Research Article
Managed Flexibility: Labour Regulation, Corporate Strategies and Market Dynamics in the Swedish Temporary Staffing Industry,Bolesław Domański;;;;;Yannick Lung;;;;;Vincent Frigant;;;;;Jean-Bernard Layan;;;;;Ulrich Jürgens;;;;;Martin Krzywdzinski;;;;;Petr Pavlínek;;;;;Bolesław Domański;;;;;Robert Guzik;;;;;Neil M. Coe;;;;;Jennifer Johns;;;;;Kevin Ward;;;;;Dilek Özdemir;;;;;James Darby;;;;;Manuel González-López;;;;;,2009,0,36,This article provides an account of the temporary staffing industry outside its two largest markets, the UK and the US. It argues that there is greater national variation in industry characteristics than has generally been acknowledged, using the example of Sweden to illustrate the importance of understanding staffing industries in relation to the regulatory context in which they are embedded. Drawing on secondary materials and interviews with senior officials in transnational and domestic temporary staffing agencies, labour unions, industry trade bodies and government departments, the article asserts that the temporary staffing industry should be understood as an active agent of labour market restructuring. It provides a detailed analysis of the Swedish industry's distinct periods of expansion, charting its legalization and subsequent growth in the context of a highly regulated labour market. In conclusion, the article makes two key points. First, the Swedish temporary staffing market is the product of a particular social democratic welfare state regime and the roles played by the different social partners which lead to the production of a managed flexibility. Second, the particularities of the Swedish system, and the need for transnational staffing agencies to adapt their activities, underline how firms both shape, and are shaped by, the economic and social characteristics and dynamics that exist in the territories in which they invest.,labour markets;national systems;regulation;Sweden;temporary staffing industry,Research Article
One Less Barrier to Foreign Direct Investment in Turkey?: Linkages Between Manufacturing and Logistics Operations in Istanbul and the Marmara Region,Bolesław Domański;;;;;Yannick Lung;;;;;Vincent Frigant;;;;;Jean-Bernard Layan;;;;;Ulrich Jürgens;;;;;Martin Krzywdzinski;;;;;Petr Pavlínek;;;;;Bolesław Domański;;;;;Robert Guzik;;;;;Neil M.

Increased production by both foreign and domestic manufacturers in the wider Marmara region has also resulted in a concentration of service sector firms in the greater Istanbul metropolitan area. Examination of the profile of foreign investors and investment categories reveals that Germany and the Netherlands remain major sources of investment, and that investment from these two countries shows the most marked signs of functional linkage between manufacturing and service projects. This growth of functional linkage, exemplified by the increased importance of logistics operations, may represent the removal of one more factor inhibiting inward investment into Turkey on a scale appropriate to its size and growth potential.,automotive sector;foreign direct investment;Istanbul;logistics;Turkey,Research Article

The results obtained indicate that KIBS interregional trade decisively shapes KIBS regional growth in such a way that, on the one hand, it contributes to the concentration of these activities in metropolitan and well-developed regions and, on the other hand, it makes KIBS growth in less developed regions (LDRs) externally dependent.,concentration;growth;knowedge-intensive business services;regions,Research Article

For this reason these countries are becoming interesting cases for a comparison of the processes of settlement, integration and conflict experienced by immigrants. Even though a comprehensive comparative analysis among European states is not entirely feasible, we can already notice certain characteristics of immigrant settlements as well as the trajectories of their social and geographic mobility. This article is mostly centred on the Italian context and discusses three themes: recent immigration in some industrial districts, female immigrants as care workers in urban centres, and finally emerging/changing social conflicts as a direct consequence of immigration fluxes. The Italian cases illustrated in this article suggest the emergence of forms of territorial settlement which are not very segregated, but may in any event be potentially conflictual. In this respect I will discuss the growing economic competition among different types of immigrant entrepreneurs, the segregation and discrimination of immigrant children in schools, and finally the ethno-spatial conflicts which recently came to the fore in Milan.,domestic labour;households;immigration;industrial districts;Italy;Roma people;segregation;welfare state,Research Article

Faulconbridge;;;;;Jonathan V. Beaverstock;;;;;Ben Derudder;;;;;Frank Witlox;;;;;Allan M. Williams;;;;;,2009,44,53,This article evaluates the contribution of Immigrants Working in Agriculture (IWA) and their socio-economic mobility over time. Up to the present, European and Greek literature has focused on immigrants' impact on metropolitan areas, in part due to the relatively insignificant role of agriculture in the European economies. Moreover, concerning the socio-economic mobility of IWA only snapshot views are available in the literature. Through field-work carried out in the northern Greek countryside, reinforced by analysis of the FADN database, we argue that the influx of immigrants in the early 1990s constituted a driving force in the development of the Greek countryside in a period during which long-term structural problems in the rural sector had condemned it to relative immobility. Immigrants' contribution is articulated at three levels. First, they enabled farmers who had abandoned agriculture to re-enter the sector and, at the same time, keep their non-agricultural jobs, thus increasing their sources of income. Additionally, IWA helped active farmers to expand their holdings, and to enrich and diversify their cultivations. Second, IWA have not displaced familial agricultural employment, as this was in decline prior to their arrival. Last, their employment allowed for a more flexible combination and specialization of capital and labour in the production process. Moreover, contrary to many developed countries, immigrants in the Greek countryside have displayed upward economic mobility over time.This is due mainly to occupational mobility in the agricultural sector and a movement to non-agricultural jobs, as well as spatial mobility between rural regions, which has increased the number of days of employment and income.,agriculture;countryside;Greece;immigration,Research Article

The article presents original analysis of data from the Labour Force Survey and a workplace case-study in the cleaning sector to highlight growing employer dependence on a very diverse pool of foreign-born labour. The article explains such dependency by drawing on interview material collected from employers, employers' associations, community organizations and policymakers. In sum, we argue that London's Migrant Division of Labour (MDL) is a product of the semi-autonomous actions taken by employers, workers and government in the particular context of London. Understanding the MDL thus needs to encompass employer demand, migrants' `dual frame of reference' and limited access to benefits, as well as employers' preference for foreign-born workers over `native' labour supply.The state is also argued to play a critical role in this employment, determining the nature and terms of immigration, the accessibility and levels of benefits, and employment regulation. London's MDL is shown to intersect with, and in some cases overturn, existing patterns of labour market segmentation on the basis of human capital (class), ethnicity and gender.,global city labour markets;hiring queue;immigration;London;low-paid work;migrant division of labour;migrant labour,Research Article

It draws on the particular example of the North East of England to ask how migrant workers are grounded in local labour markets, and uses this case-study to examine the interrelations between migration and labour markets. The article explores the role of different institutions — public and private — at different scales in mediating and regulating the labour market participation of migrant workers, and reviews the processes of A8 labour migration in the context of debates over regional labour markets and skills. In short, the article reflects in both conceptual and policy terms on the place of migrant workers in peripheral regions, and connects the analysis to debates over the potential contribution of migration to regional labour markets and economies, as policymakers increasingly look to migration for rejuvenation of skills and employment.,accession;Central Europe;migration;North East;peripheral regions,Research Article
Corporate Ecologies of Business Travel in Professional Service Firms: Working Towards a Research Agenda,Diane Perrons;;;;;Enzo Mingione;;;;;Lois Labrianidis;;;;;Theodosis Sykas;;;;;Jane Wills;;;;;Jon May;;;;;Kavita Datta;;;;;Yara Evans;;;;;Joanna Herbert;;;;;Cathy McIlwaine;;;;;Alison Stenning;;;;;Stuart Dawley;;;;;James R.

It is surprising, therefore, that relatively little time has been devoted to the study of business travel, both as a facet of contemporary mobility and as an economic practice. In this article we review how existing literatures provide insights that can be used to understand the role of business travel as international labour mobility in the contemporary professional service economy. In doing so, we reach the conclusion that there seem to be at least two significant voids preventing a more sophisticated understanding from emerging. First, we suggest that international business travel needs to be studied not in isolation but instead as one component in a wider ecology of mobility which `produces' the global firm. Second, we argue that it is important to know more about the time-space dynamics of international business travel in terms of how spatial relations are produced and reproduced by different forms and geographies of travel. We make these arguments and explore their implications using data collected through interviews in advertising, architecture and legal professional service firms.We conclude by identifying a research agenda designed to allow a better understanding of business travel to emerge in corporate and mobility discourses.,business travel;Europe;mobility;professional services,Research Article

Second, it considers how changes in the nature of mobility have implications for uneven regional development. Third, it develops the concept of enfolded mobilities, as a way of understanding how individual migrations are directly enfolded with those of other individuals, either through associated or contingent movements, or through consequential migration at later stages in the life course. Finally, it discusses how governance impinges on and mediates the key relationships between mobility and uneven regional development.,enfolded mobility;governance;human capital;knowledge;regions;uneven development;urban polarization,Research Article

Pavia;;;;;,2010,57,11,In recent years partnership has become an established aspect of rural development across rural Europe. Both Wales and the Netherlands have seen similar trends towards more decentralized and territorial modes of rural governance in which policy networks of governmental and societal actors work together at a local or regional level to further rural development. Such networks are called ‘partnerships’ in English and ‘gebiedscommissies’ in Dutch. This paper addresses differences in the composition and organization of rural partnerships in these two countries and attributes the differences between them to the policy context in each country. Four policy factors are identified as contributing to the specific approach to partnership adopted in the two countries.The review sustains the presumption that in Dutch rural partnerships the integration discourse is more important than the participation discourse, which is more prominent in Wales.,integration;participation;rural partnership;rural policy,Research Article
Mistrust and Lack of Market Innovation: A Case Study of Loss of Competitiveness in a Seafood Industry,Kjell Overvåg;;;;;Petra Derkzen;;;;;Knut Bjørn Lindkvist;;;;;Michela Lazzeroni;;;;;José Antonio Belso-Martínez;;;;;Stefan Krätke;;;;;Beatriz Larraz Iribas;;;;;Jose M. Pavia;;;;;,2010,38,15,The fundamental problem discussed in this article is the lack of accord between market adaptation and traditional production practices, which may result in a loss of competitiveness in some industries. A key question of this article is why salted fish consumers in Spain, formerly an important market for Norwegian salted fish producers, are seemingly unable to influence production practices within the Norwegian salted fish industry. The Norwegians have lost significant market share in Spain because of their failure to meet the demand for new products, which required different production methods. Based on institutional and evolutionary economic theories and focusing on production systems, institutional rigidity and path dependency, this article analyses two causes of market failure: the structural conditions for industrial adaptation; and mistrust among most of the core actors in the Norwegian salted fish industry. Mistrust is one significant reason for the failure to establish networks and collective innovation practices in order to adapt to market demands. The article concludes that, instead, actors in the seafood industry developed an ‘imaginary innovation system’ in which they believed that they were innovative and competitive, whereas in reality they were defending individual positions within traditional production practices.,conventions;imaginary innovation systems;market adaptation systems;trust;production,Research Article
High-Tech Activities, System Innovativeness and Geographical Concentration: Insights Into Technological Districts in Italy,Kjell Overvåg;;;;;Petra Derkzen;;;;;Knut Bjørn Lindkvist;;;;;Michela Lazzeroni;;;;;José Antonio Belso-Martínez;;;;;Stefan Krätke;;;;;Beatriz Larraz Iribas;;;;;Jose M. Pavia;;;;;,2010,0,21,Within the field of the geography of knowledge and technological innovation, specific attention has been paid to the phenomenon of the spatial concentration of high-tech activities and to the factors that influence the growth of new industrial areas. Within this research stream, the present work is focused on areas characterized by high levels of specialization in high-tech, and more specifically on the concept of technological districts. Technological districts (TDs) are considered to be territorial systems specialized in high-tech activities and characterized by the presence of innovative resources, such as qualified human capital, advanced research activities, the capacity to generate innovation and new technologies, and an entrepreneurial culture. Beyond discussing theoretical concepts, a methodology is proposed for the analysis and identification of TDs through the definition of a taxonomy of local systems with different levels of concentration of high-tech activities and innovative resources. The methodology has been applied to Italy and allows the identification of the most advanced technological areas, which present the basic characteristics of TDs. This methodology is also important because it can be used to compare different geographical contexts and to discuss and evaluate different possibilities in the field of innovation development policies.,geographical concentration;high-tech activities;innovation;local systems;system innovativeness;technological districts,Research Article

We examine changes in the occupational structure and in segregation indices from 1991 to 2001. Findings suggest that new gender and ethnic divisions in the occupational structure combine with residential mobility and introduce strong tendencies towards spatial fragmentation. Intra-urban and migratory flows reflect diversified occupational trajectories among women and contribute to shaping the socioeconomic profile of the destination areas: (a) migrant domestic and unskilled service workers locate to central city and suburban areas; (b) Greek managers and professionals, move to ‘upper-class suburbs’; (c) small Greek entrepreneurs and independent workers sprawl to peri-urban areas; (d) salespersons and clerks move to inner suburban areas.",geographical mobility;occupational restructuring;polarization;segregation,"Research Article"

The challenges and shifts were particularly strong in the chemical industry, which had developed a structure of mass production characterized by an unsustainable exploitation of natural and economic resources. Drawing on a conception that views transformation and restructuring as a process of regional ruptures and re-bundling, rather than one that focuses on the lock-in of old industrialized regions, this article investigates the extent to which restructuring activities have been able to generate self-sustaining regional economies and networks in the East German chemical industry.The article is based on empirical research conducted in the regions of Leuna, Schkopau and Bitterfeld-Wolfen, which provides evidence that restructuring in the chemical industry did not create fully fledged clusters with strong interfirm linkages.Although the regional economies of the East German chemical industry were well linked to West Germany and to international markets through corporate ties, networks for learning and innovation remained weak.The development of these ‘hollow clusters’ was due to the persistence of a small industry basis, the dominance of branch operations with few local ties, and the limited importance of start-up firms. Such conditions, consequently, limit the prospects for growth in the East German chemical industry, suggesting that more diversified regional policies must be developed in the future.",chemical industry;East Germany;German reunification;hollow clusters;regional re-bundling,"Research Article"

A key element in this structure is the creation of regions at the NUTS-II level which will be equipped with Regional Development Agencies (RDAs). Yet the present political and economic situation in Turkey throws some doubt on the scope and future for RDA development. To what extent will the central state be able and willing to devolve authority and resources to the local level? And to what extent do regional institutional and business settings hold fertile ground for RDA development? The article will address these questions, first, by focusing on the broader political-institutional context of region and RDA formation; and, second, through a detailed case-study of one regional setting, namely Istanbul. The outcomes indeed point to a fragile basis for RDA development from both political and economic perspectives.

Temporal mismatch between adjustments of the housing stock and regional change may lead to variations in the incidence of vacant housing units, over time and over space.Within this context this article analyses the determinants of exit rates from the housing stock in use and what determines the utilization of vacant housing units. This article demonstrates empirically that changes in the stock of vacancies in the housing stock within a municipality increase as one moves from the most central parts of the country towards the less central parts. Furthermore, the growth in the stock of vacant housing correlates positively with the share of inhabitants aged 65 years or over. We relate these empirical findings to a particular form of centralization which has taken place in Norway over the last 50 years: upon leaving the parental home, young people have often left the peripheral parts of the country.As their childhood homes were still inhabited by their parents, they did not leave any vacant housing units behind them.After some 30—50 years, the parents have died. Hence, a centralization process may produce vacant housing units — with a time lag of up to 30—50 years.",centralization;housing stock;rural housing;vacancies,"Research Article"

We find, for example, that the firms’ innovation partners and knowledge sources are quite similar irrespective of location. This may indicate that the relevant innovation systems in knowledge-intensive industries in Norway are sectoral and national rather than regional. The paper also finds that the small urban regions and the rural regions have a higher share of innovating, knowledge-intensive firms than the large urban regions, which may partly be explained by a much higher rate of public funding of innovation activity in the first two regional types. However, the large urban regions have higher new firm formation rates and more radically innovating firms than the other two types of region.

Norway and Sweden are similar in many respects and the Scandinavian Peninsula therefore represents an attractive natural laboratory with one country inside and another outside the European Union. The data cover five-year intervals from 1980 to 2000 for Norway and from 1985 for Sweden. We find strong productivity convergence between Norwegian counties and weak divergence between Swedish ones. The effect of the industry structure on the spatial distribution of productivity appears to be small in magnitude, but it is qualitatively important. Moreover, the role played by the changing composition of production in the process of economic growth seems to differ over time. By implication, considerable caution should be exercised when undertaking convergence studies based on the commonly used one-sector growth model. More complex models allowing for differences in industry structure, and possibly also other potentially important factors such as wealth effects and transitional dynamics, should be considered.",comparative study;European regions;Norway;productivity convergence;Sweden,"Other"

To explain this apparent conundrum, this paper has two interlinked aims: (1) to investigate why, how, for whom and when the North/South divide is held to be a relevant ‘policy geography’ and (2) to explain the accompanying debates about the internal geography of this North/South divide. To do this, the paper develops a cultural politics of scales approach that compares the discursive (re)construction of the North/South divide in Italy and England by focusing on key moments, particularly the Keynesian consensus after the Second World War and the more current turn to neoliberal policies. Two parallel trends are identified: that support for an interventionist state and regional subsidies to poorer regions has decreased and that the North/South divide as a dual national partition has been dissolved into a micro-diverse geography. The paper concludes that the North/South divide is a contested political geography interpreted in different ways and used as a ‘discursive device’ by different actors to fit wider political projects.",discourse;Mezzogiorno;North/South divide;Northern England;uneven development,"Other"

This paper examines the role envisaged for the Opera House in Oslo, which opened in April 2008. The study looks at the motivations and justifications for the building, examined through interviews with individuals who played an important role in the project. Research findings suggest that the Opera House is best understood as a cultural and national symbol, although it was also designed to assist urban regeneration and development. One of the interesting aspects of the project is the way artistic and regeneration justifications were coupled to ensure the project came to fruition. Other roles seem to have emerged that were not necessarily planned or expected. Tourism effects have been witnessed and its innovative design means the new Opera House functions as both a marketing symbol and a visitor attraction in its own right. The case demonstrates the value of focusing good urban design, with the possible bonus of external image enhancement, rather than relying on an iconic building and a ‘look at me’ effect. Thus, the Opera House may represent a less speculative type of iconic building — where bombastic design and external focus are replaced with more attention to public access and a local orientation.",flagships;icons;marketing;regeneration;waterfronts,"Other"

Festivals are often strategically conceived with the purpose of promoting a ‘distinctive city’, in line with uniqueness being the keystone of success in the experience economy. This paper applies an experience economy framework to analyse city festivals as potentially transformative practices, helping re-imagine urban space and reshape urban identity. Building on empirical studies of the Stockholm Culture Festival and the Nowy Kercelak Fair in Warsaw, it examines the tension between controlled image production and carnivalesque celebration and the extent to which the meanings and flow of urban space can be managed. Using Lefèbvre’s notion of the production of space and Deleuze and Guattari’s concepts of de-territorialization and re-territorialization, this paper critically assesses the possibility of reshaping urban practices through the staging of festivals, and the potential for creativity and expression extant in managed staging of experience.",city marketing;experience economy;festival;urban space,"Research Article"

After months, if not years, of speculation, the company had finally decided to move all its European manufacturing from Limerick to Lodz in Poland. Among the many reasons cited – from the global economic downturn to a shifting market – cost-competitiveness became the clear determining factor. The media coverage was extensive, with the headline ‘Dell Closes’ bandied about in the national and regional press. Though of little consolation to the 1900 left without a job, the fact remains that Dell has not closed its Limerick operation, where it will continue to employ upwards of 1000 in sales support and research and development. We use the Dell story as an exemplar of the Irish foreign direct investment (FDI) story. Comparing it with other restructurings by foreign-owned technology companies both in Ireland and beyond we will attempt to uncover the complexity of shifting competitiveness and competencies among branches of global operations.

The research is based on interviews with senior managers in 25 companies in the three case-study countries, as well as inward investment agencies. We conclude that the most salient static impacts of these investments are on the labour market, where horizontal investments provide fewer, but more skilled jobs than vertical investments. Dynamic effects were contradictory in that, although learning and spillover effects were modest, vertical investments demonstrated a propensity to move up the value chain.

Originating from North America (Canada and the United States), this model of self-taxing districts, often based on public–private partnerships, has spread to other continents, including Europe, Australia and Africa. This theme issue explores the internationalization and the contextualization of the BID model in both Northern countries (the United States, Canada, Germany and Sweden) and Southern countries (South Africa). The collection of articles focuses on key debates surrounding BIDs and presents different theoretical perspectives as well as lines of argument in relation to these debates. Relying on approaches based on political economy and local governance regimes, Foucault-inspired sociology of governance and governmentality studies or critical discourse analysis, the authors discuss the nature and significance of BIDs in relation to state restructuring and the neoliberalization of urban policies and to emergent rationalities and practices of security governance and policing arrangements. Using the recent discussions of policy transfer and ‘urban policy mobilities’, they look at the international circulation of the BID model and its local embeddedness, exploring the role of the global circuits of knowledge and the ways in which the model has been adopted and reshaped in different cities. Drawing a complex and differentiated picture of BIDs across continents and cities, this collection of articles emphasizes both the need for more comparative research across diverse urban experiences and contexts and the relevance of a relational perspective in urban studies that blurs the traditional lines of separation between studies of Northern and Southern cities.",Business Improvement Districts;neoliberalization;policing;policy transfer;security;urban policy mobilities;urban regeneration,"Editorial"

The Norwegians have lost significant market share in Spain because of their failure to meet the demand for new products, which required different production methods. Based on institutional and evolutionary economic theories and focusing on production systems, institutional rigidity and path dependency, this article analyses two causes of market failure: the structural conditions for industrial adaptation; and mistrust among most of the core actors in the Norwegian salted fish industry. Mistrust is one significant reason for the failure to establish networks and collective innovation practices in order to adapt to market demands. The article concludes that, instead, actors in the seafood industry developed an ‘imaginary innovation system’ in which they believed that they were innovative and competitive, whereas in reality they were defending individual positions within traditional production practices.",conventions;imaginary innovation systems;market adaptation systems;trust;production,"Research Article"

Beyond discussing theoretical concepts, a methodology is proposed for the analysis and identification of TDs through the definition of a taxonomy of local systems with different levels of concentration of high-tech activities and innovative resources. The methodology has been applied to Italy and allows the identification of the most advanced technological areas, which present the basic characteristics of TDs.

We find, for example, that the firms’ innovation partners and knowledge sources are quite similar irrespective of location. This may indicate that the relevant innovation systems in knowledge-intensive industries in Norway are sectoral and national rather than regional. The paper also finds that the small urban regions and the rural regions have a higher share of innovating, knowledge-intensive firms than the large urban regions, which may partly be explained by a much higher rate of public funding of innovation activity in the first two regional types. However, the large urban regions have higher new firm formation rates and more radically innovating firms than the other two types of region.

Further, actors must be guided in their decision-making and action by the new vision, and this requires that they are persuaded of its viability through the provision of test cases and supportive resources and institutions. In order for new ideas to become guiding models, actors must be convinced of their desirability through the portrayal of models as a means of confronting competitive challenges and serving the economic interests of the city/region.

Since material, imaginative and practised ruralities are intertwined and research indicates that representations of the rural affect residential preferences and other consumption activities, we argue that it is important to critically investigate potentially influential representations. Given that the majority of works on representations of the rural in mass media originate mainly from the United Kingdom and the United States, we aim to add the perspectives of a Scandinavian and a Mediterranean country. Furthermore, we analyse the gendering of the visions of the rural. We reveal that the ‘rural idyll’ is the main vision ‘sold’ in both magazines, and in both the same four sub-themes — ‘home’, ‘family’, ‘nature’ and ‘how to make a living in a rural area’ — stand central in the idyll. The gendering of the idyll and the meanings attached to the sub-themes vary between the Spanish and the Norwegian magazines, thus illustrating the contextual character of knowledge about rurality.",gender;lifestyle magazine;Norway;rurality;rural idyll;Spain,"Other"

Having earlier relied on traditional industry as the source of employment, many peripheral regions are today struggling to survive in a completely changed economic landscape, with new conditions for development. The dismantling of trade barriers, the accessibility of new markets for production, and faster and cheaper modes of communication and transportation — the underpinnings of concepts such as globalization and new economy — have combined to change the conditions for development. Based on two case studies, this article analyses the industrial dynamics and the role of policy in the transformation of peripheral regions in advanced nations. Through analysing the development of two Swedish municipalities — once home to vibrant forest-based industrial activities — it is shown that there are certain policy limitations in fundamentally transforming the development paths of peripheral regions.",call centres;ICT;Keynesian multipliers;Marshallian dynamics;peripheral regions;regional development policy,"Other"

In turn, this literature has shown little interest in variety within national models of capitalism, an issue more often tackled by economic geographers. This paper asks if the Varieties of Capitalism (VoC) framework of Hall and Soskice is a useful tool for investigating institutional disparity within national models, and if it can indicate deviation from national or sectoral norms that may provide insights into the success or failure of local clusters. It applies the framework to two Swedish furniture locations — Tibro and Virserum — that together dominated the industry in the mid-1940s. Today, Tibro maintains its leading position whereas Virserum has been wiped off the map in terms of furniture production. The paper finds that applying the framework in this rather unorthodox manner does indeed paint a more nuanced picture of a rather coherent Swedish institutional system, and that there is varying scope for local creativity among the predetermined institutional spheres of VoC. In particular, the paper illustrates how local outcomes of national systems may differ across space, depending on particular configurations of institutional and non-institutional factors at local and sectoral levels playing themselves out against national developments.",clusters;economic geography;furniture industry;institutional theory;varieties of capitalism,"Other"

A geographical approach to justice and equity must consider the interaction of place distributions and people distributions of income and opportunity. Place and people distributions may conflict with one another. Moreover, different such distributions have different impacts on economic efficiency and thus on aggregate output.

In the years to come, developed country growth is likely to remain slow because no alternative high-growth model is on the horizon. A country such as China conversely has the potential to continue to grow relatively fast provided it can profoundly alter its model of development in ways that address global and national imbalances. If it and other large emerging economies do achieve further sustained growth, this will in effect reverse the gap created by industrial revolution, colonialism and imperialism.

The data cover five-year intervals from 1980 to 2000 for Norway and from 1985 for Sweden. We find strong productivity convergence between Norwegian counties and weak divergence between Swedish ones. The effect of the industry structure on the spatial distribution of productivity appears to be small in magnitude, but it is qualitatively important. Moreover, the role played by the changing composition of production in the process of economic growth seems to differ over time. By implication, considerable caution should be exercised when undertaking convergence studies based on the commonly used one-sector growth model. More complex models allowing for differences in industry structure, and possibly also other potentially important factors such as wealth effects and transitional dynamics, should be considered.",comparative study;European regions;Norway;productivity convergence;Sweden,"Other"

To do this, the paper develops a cultural politics of scales approach that compares the discursive (re)construction of the North/South divide in Italy and England by focusing on key moments, particularly the Keynesian consensus after the Second World War and the more current turn to neoliberal policies.

This paper examines the role envisaged for the Opera House in Oslo, which opened in April 2008. The study looks at the motivations and justifications for the building, examined through interviews with individuals who played an important role in the project. Research findings suggest that the Opera House is best understood as a cultural and national symbol, although it was also designed to assist urban regeneration and development. One of the interesting aspects of the project is the way artistic and regeneration justifications were coupled to ensure the project came to fruition. Other roles seem to have emerged that were not necessarily planned or expected. Tourism effects have been witnessed and its innovative design means the new Opera House functions as both a marketing symbol and a visitor attraction in its own right. The case demonstrates the value of focusing good urban design, with the possible bonus of external image enhancement, rather than relying on an iconic building and a ‘look at me’ effect. Thus, the Opera House may represent a less speculative type of iconic building — where bombastic design and external focus are replaced with more attention to public access and a local orientation.",flagships;icons;marketing;regeneration;waterfronts,"Other"

To do so, this paper examines concrete instances of cosmopolitan practice that actually promote the maintenance of the nation-state reality currently characterizing the European Union. These examples show that, at the intersection of the subnational/supranational and supranational/national levels, contradictions are instrumentalized, creating bottom-up and top-down flows of power and influence between all European scales. The evidence presented in this paper indicates that these flows are unintended side-effects that drive Europeanization processes in a way that allows for the simultaneous promotion and regulation of European diversity. This implies that carefully managed and instrumentalized contradictions are powerful engines of Europeanization that actively transform European governance.",Cohesion policy;European Union;Europeanization;geopolitics;Structural funds,"Research Article"

The basic assumption is that high European wage levels make it unlikely that less research-intensive parts of the economy can withstand competition from low-wage countries with increasingly skilled labour forces. Thus, the inferior growth of the European Union (EU) in the 1990s compared with the USA has been explained by the latter’s higher rate of R&D investments. The paper challenges this rather simplistic view of innovation and examines the regional consequences of such policies. EU growth has caught up with that of the USA during recent years and low-tech industries continue to have considerable economic importance in Europe in terms of jobs and value added, especially outside the main growth regions, but also in the major urban regions. Empirical evidence from Denmark and the UK provided in the paper suggests that low- and high-tech industries are closely interconnected because low-tech firms play important roles both as partners in the innovation processes of high-tech firms and as buyers of high-tech products. Therefore, EU industrial policy is not appropriate because it overlooks the continuing significance of low-tech industries. Furthermore, the rather uniform focus on R&D is associated with a strong emphasis on large city-regions where research-intensive industries are concentrated and, thus, increasing regional inequality in Europe is being produced.",EU industrial policy;firm linkages;innovation;low-tech industries;regional inequality,"Research Article"

The closures at Dortmund (permanently) and Redcar/south Teesside (temporarily) both reflected the growing international – not to say global – restructuring of the steel industry and the strategies that steel-producing companies adopted in the face of profound changes in markets and patterns of production and trade. To that extent, at first sight this might appear to be a familiar and not unexpected outcome of those processes. However, the outcomes both at local level and for the steel plants themselves turned out to be very different because they reflected the complexity of global processes and the interacting effects of many influences operating at different spatial scales within the complex social relations of capital. Not least this was because the closure in Dortmund and the ending of steel-making there were directly implicated in a major expansion of steel production in China, by Shagang in Jiangsu Province, via the transfer of a major steel complex, disassembled in Dortmund and reassembled in Jinfeng. The disassembly of a major production complex, its transport to the other side of the world and its reassembly there as functional fixed capital added a dramatic and radical new twist to the meaning of global shift.",China;disassembly;globalization;plant closure;relocation;steel,"Research Article"

As a consensus-finding organization, the OECD is more of a mediator than a unilateral driver of policy conventions. It is not a site of hard-edged or radical policy innovation, but seeks to define a ‘common ground’ in the form of a positive policy consensus. As such, the OECD’s coordinative discourse both reflects and refracts a particular reading of the ‘soft center’ of the urban policy consensus, revealing how (far) this has moved since the early 1980s.

In this context, migrants reconfigure the meanings of belonging against dominant spatializations through their everyday practices. Moreover, more or less institutionalized forms of political participation create new spatial levels of citizenship not limited to the scale of the nation-state. Interactions among migrants and locals continuously redefine the subject of rights as they activate processes of access, participation and inclusion/exclusion in/from the urban public sphere.

We focus in particular on neighbouring as the space and resource of belonging and on how this is related to participation and urban citizenship.

Over the long-term delivery phase, such area-based interventions are often confronted with unforeseen macro-scale urban dynamics related to mobility of people and capital. Since the mid-1980s, Barcelona’s municipality has introduced a series of urban renewal programmes – PERIs (Special Plans of Interior Reform) – to deal with deprived neighbourhoods of the city centre suffering from poor housing conditions, inadequate services and infrastructure, and decreasing population. Selective demolition (or esponjamiento) was a key mechanism to create new open spaces in the crowded city centre whilst building new housing stock to relocate families. Urban interventions ranged from large-scale demolition of entire blocks in the Raval neighbourhood to micro-scale demolitions in the Santa Caterina & Sant Pere neighbourhood.

We argue that, although there exists by now a vast literature by geographers and other scholars that engages with the production of ‘EU’ropean spaces through regionalization, the policy literature generated by EU ‘macro-regional experts’ appears to entirely ignore these debates, professing an understanding of regions that is a conceptual pastiche at best, and that entirely occludes the political and geopolitical implications of region-making within, at, and beyond ‘EU’rope’s borders",Borders;Europe;European Union;Mediterranean;regions,"Research Article"

The significance of this application far outstrips the size of this small island state since Iceland’s relationship with ‘EUrope’ is long-standing and complex. This national drama is given greater political salience as it is projected against the backdrop of ‘EUrope’s own existential struggles over the post-1945 political project of integration currently underway.

As the EU has sought to control flows of people, money and goods through these new borders, it has also become a destination for irregular migrants and small-scale traders from its eastern neighbours. This article draws upon participant observation in one such community in western Ukraine, where continuing levels of high unemployment and low wages and pensions drive dependence on flows of remittances from migrants to southern Europe, but also revenues from small-scale trade with neighbouring EU members, such as Romania. New forms of transnational mobility have emerged, which are not gender-neutral. The article asserts that, while hegemonic masculinities exist in both Ukrainian and Romanian communities, gender relations in Romania are restricted by sexualised discourses. As male and female Ukrainian traders interact with Romanian border officials and local distributors and intermediaries, hegemonic masculinities in Ukraine are re-affirmed and female traders are unable to advance and develop their trade in the same way as their male counterparts. In doing so, the article expands research on gender and transnationalism in post-enlargement Europe beyond migration and demonstrates not only how encounters at the EU’s borders are shaping gender relations in communities outside the EU, but that involvement in cross-border economic activities is determined by the gendered discourses and performance that take place at the border.",Borders;Europe;gender;informal economy;post-socialism,"Research Article"

Following the fall of the Soviet Union, more positive experiences of development associated with the opening of the border became apparent. However, Poland’s accession to the European Union (EU) and the Schengen area limited flows of people and goods once more. Is it true, then, to say that today’s eastern frontier of the Union is a spatial barrier limiting borderland socioeconomic development? Or perhaps the reverse is true, with the EU frontier actually stimulating local development? To address such questions, this paper discusses research carried out in Poland’s Lubelskie Province (voivodship), which borders both Belarus and Ukraine. The research is based on extensive interviews with representatives of local authorities and on questionnaires distributed among residents of the communes (gminas) located in closest proximity to the border. The results obtained show that socioeconomic development is first and foremost present near border crossings, reflecting both EU support for improved border-crossing infrastructure and local-level entrepreneurship reflecting locational benefits, especially for firms in the services, commerce and logistic sectors. In turn, areas located further away from border crossings are seen to feature distinct economic peripheralization, to the extent that the EU’s external frontier has to be perceived as a spatial barrier that hinders local development.",Border region;frontier of EU;local development;Lubelskie Province;Poland,"Research Article"

Although the socioeconomic contributions of informal activities have been widely acknowledged, little research has been conducted on the ways that enlargement of the European Union (EU), by affecting the openness/closedness of borders, affected the nature and extent of cross-border informal entrepreneurial activities (IEAs). Recognizing the heterogeneity of border regions, in terms of formal and social institutional structures, linguistics and ethnicity, the paper offers a nuanced and extended understanding of the difference the geography of borders, broadly defined, makes to the diversity and persistence/disappearance of cross-border IEAs since EU enlargement. Using qualitative data from interviews collected with households involved in cross-border IEAs in several EU border regions, the paper indicates that cross-border IEAs have a time dimension, reflected in the pre- and post-enlargement changes to the intensity of these activities, as well as a regional dimension, reflected in various dichotomies such as impoverished/affluent, socioculturally proximate/distant and hard/soft borders, reflected in the forms, enablers and constraints of such activities. The paper illustrates how the spatial, economic, institutional and sociocultural characteristics of a context overlap, dominate or recede at different points in time to facilitate/inhibit different forms of entrepreneurial behaviour and to encourage the involvement of, or empower, different groups of people. Thus, context, in all its dimensions, remains an important factor for spatial and temporal explanations of cross-border IEAs as particular forms of entrepreneurial activity.",Border;borderland;EU enlargement;informal cross-border activities;regional development,"Research Article"

These networks include personal links, professional and social relations and other types of local social connections related to people’s life courses. This appeared to be strong and consistent outcomes of a survey among employees and interviews with employers, managers and trans-national migrants, conducted simultaneously in 13 European cities. It was also made clear that so-called hard conditions, especially job availability, were the second most important factor. Incidentally soft conditions were relevant, but never of prime importance. ‘Soft’ factors such as diversity, openness, amenities, and tolerance were hardly mentioned as relevant deciding factors for settling in a specific city. It also became clear that contemporary conditions that make some European cities more attractive than others for these industries offer only a partial explanation.

On the one hand, the influence of urbanisation and the intensification and continued up-scaling of agriculture make it more difficult for many regions to remain distinctive and increase sustainability. Places, as well as goods and services, have become increasingly interchangeable. For many regions an obvious choice is to compete with other regions for global mobile capital and labour. On the other hand, and as a counterforce to these global logics, new strategies, which are more place-based, are being developed, such as the construction of identities or images around new agricultural goods and services. These strategies can be seen in the context of the ‘New Rural Paradigm’ for European rural regions. In the search for new trajectories for sustainable development, different models can be identified: the bio-economy paradigm and the eco-economy. Each model has its own sustainability claim and can be analysed in the context of the overarching development theory of ecological modernisation. The central question in this article is what types of strategies and pathways for eco-economic development can be witnessed in rural regions in Europe? The empirical analysis is based on 62 European cases. Three key eco-economic strategies that show a shift from an agricultural-based development to a more integrative rural and regionally based development are identified.

Yet despite its prominence the region remains a largely Delphian concept. In the period of new regionalist orthodoxy, for example, while it was recognized that regions take various forms, the normative claim that we were living in a ‘regional world’ became narrowly focused on regions as subnational political units. Nevertheless, the emergence of city-regions, cross-border regions, and European Metropolitan Regions is leading some scholars to suggest the formation in this century of a brave new ‘regional world’. With economic, social and political activity increasingly orchestrated through regional spaces that cross-cut the territorial map that prevailed through much of the twentieth century, the literature is adorned with accounts advancing the theoretical and policy rationale for relational approaches to regions and regionalism. Yet far less has been written on the struggle to construct these spaces politically, thereby neglecting questions of territory and territorial politics. With this in mind, our paper draws on the experience of Germany to consider the political struggle to overcome the contradictions, overlaps, and competing tendencies that result from new regional spaces appearing alongside, rather than replacing, existing forms of state scalar organization. In particular, we observe how the Federal State is using the ambiguity of the regional concept to present territorial and relational approaches as complementary alternatives. The paper concludes by relating these findings to ongoing debates on how we, as ‘regional’ researchers, should approach the analysis of regions and regionalism; speculates on the degree to which they form progressive and effective spatial policies; and asks what lessons can be learnt about contemporary state spatiality more generally.",European Metropolitan Regions;Germany;networks;planning;regions;territory,"Research Article"

Isolated from an initial and non-discriminate England-wide clustering analysis of 73 Audit Commission-defined quality of life indicators, the results of our study reveal that pivotal to London’s prevailing quality of life distribution is the influence of deprivation, health and educational inequalities, all of which are masked at a pure ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ London comparison, capable only of distinguishing the city’s borough-level transport and community safety diversity.

By using data from a large northern Italian region, the analysis yields employment impact estimates of the policies under plausible identification assumptions. The paper finds no significant difference between the employment impacts of ERDF co-funded and national/regional programs, whereas, regardless of the funding body, the absolute per-firm employment effects of the programs are increasingly larger the higher the economic value of the incentives. However, the most generous incentives come with a much higher cost per each additional new job.

These policies are part of processes of de-bordering and political rescaling that have profoundly affected cross-border areas by creating new institutional territories and political structures. The purpose of this paper is to study the institutional history of cross-border metropolitan governance in Europe through the comparison of two of the most advanced cross-border metropolitan regions: Lille and Luxembourg. This paper asks how these cross-border structures have developed and changed. What can their patterns of institutional evolution contribute to understanding governance in other cross-border regions? Are these new spaces evidence of political rescaling? This paper presents and redefines cross-border governance as a cyclical and a long-term process and also explores the challenges that these partnerships face in becoming functionally effective and autonomous policy actors. Ultimately, we find that there is no replicable ideal of cross-border governance and that even long-standing partnerships are in a period of exploration and reinvention. Establishing a competitive and coherent cross-border metropolitan region is ambitious and complex, and it necessitates the coordination of policies at multiple scales and across institutionally diverse territories. This project requires the modification and/or construction of new institutional and legal frameworks. This reorientation of political attention has resulted in a reconceptualization of political space but not the empowerment of new political actors, indicating that the process of rescaling may be a work in progress.",Cross-border cooperation;cross-border governance;cross-border metropolitan region;political and territorial rescaling,"Research Article"

Decision-making power is increasingly delegated to territorial authorities on the assumption that local agents possess both contextual knowledge and political legitimacy to integrate different policy measures in a cooperative fashion. Within contexts of structural socioeconomic constraints, problems of coordination are associated with policy co-formulation, governance network management, meta-governance processes, and performance management and evaluation use. This paper aims to examine the variety of coordination mechanisms adopted by regional government agencies in order to collaborate with local authorities to stimulate economically lagging territories. The paper analyses management techniques of local organizational capacity and network building, project development, monitoring and evaluation, highlighting the rationale of regional development policies and the role of institutions. Building upon 2 years of field research on local development programmes in four regions in the south of Italy, this paper shows that cooperation co-exists with opportunistic behaviour during programme design and implementation, while bureaucratic culture and organizational weaknesses hamper managerial leadership and administrative decentralization. Findings highlight that centrally guided decentralization is a more sustainable capacity-building strategy. Furthermore, perceived efficiency, equity, uncertainty, and relational quality shape coordination and its evolution over time. Interpersonal relations may increase to reduce uncertainty, or higher procedural formalization may ensure efficiency, equity, and fair dealings. The evolution of coordination mechanisms has a bearing on administrative capacity of public spending absorption against corruption and waste as well as on the potential for economic development and social cohesion.",Coordination;local development programmes;delegation;cooperation;institutional analysis,"Research Article"

Within this context, Italy has become one of the major European destinations for migrants; their numbers have more than tripled during the years 2000–2010. This paper analyses the changing demography of (legal) migrants to Italy, as well as their settlement patterns and spatial distribution over time. Since the onset of the new millennium, immigrant populations in Southern Europe in general, and in Italy in particular, have been experiencing rapidly increasing volumes and rapidly changing demographics. The feminization of foreign population, its changing age structure and ethnic composition are some of the most striking features. Meanwhile, noteworthy changes have been registered in the spatial distribution of immigrants.

Though the migrant population in Italy remains more concentrated in the north, disparities between north–centre and south have decreased over the last decade. Analysis at a lower spatial level (Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics level 3) shows a higher variability across time and counties, partly due to a changing ethnic composition and the increased numbers of immigrants.",Ethnic characteristics;immigration trends;Italy;regional migration;Southern Europe,"Research Article"

The analysis reveals the importance of the dynamic and interactive character of the different aspects of the framework of institutionalisation. The region formation processes in the two regions also indicate the importance of individual catalysts, people who stimulate synergies between the different aspects of the process, resulting in the (re)production of the region and its identity.

The aim of this article is to analyse relations between cities and Europe, focusing on the practical ways in which local policies have been ‘Europeanized’ in four French cities. The article highlights three main results. First, CIVITAS does not represent a sufficient financial incentive to sustain ‘download Europeanization’ of local transport policies, which remain under the control of local authorities. Second, despite a lack of European funding, local authorities mobilize strongly on a European level in order to distinguish themselves. In a context where French transport authorities are becoming increasingly dependent on local financial resources, entering the CIVITAS programme and acquiring this seal of approval has played a determining role in legitimizing and boosting budget allocations to public transport. Third, the mobilization of local authorities and the selective strategy of the European Commission jointly strengthen political competition between cities at a European level and reinforce a network of innovative cities.",CIVITAS;Europeanization;rescaling;urban transport policies,"Research Article"

Understanding the social and economic impacts of these shifts is a major challenge for policymakers. Richard Florida’s ideas have provided a popular – and pervasive – framework for doing so. This paper assess Florida’s legacy and sets out a ‘post-Florida’ framework for ‘technology, talent and tolerance’ research. The paper first traces the development of Florida’s ideas. ‘Florida 1.0’, encapsulated by the Three Ts framework, has performed badly in practice. There are problems in bringing causality to the fundamental relationships, and in consistently replicating the results in other countries. ‘Florida 2.0’, though suggests that Creative Class metrics have value as alternative measures of human capital. This create space for a post-Florida agenda based on economic micro-foundations. I argue that the growing body of ‘economics of diversity’ research meets these conditions, and review theory and empirics. Urban ‘diversity shocks’ shift the size and composition of populations and workforces, with impacts operating via labour markets, and through wider production and consumption networks. While short-term labour market effects are small, over time low-value industrial sectors may become migrant-dependent. Diversity may help raise productivity and wages through innovation, entrepreneurship, market access and trade channels. Bigger, more diverse cities help generate hybridised goods and services, but may also raise local costs through crowding. All of this presents new challenges for policymakers, who need to manage diversity’s net effects, and address both economic costs and benefits.",Creative class;diversity;economic development;immigration;innovation,"Research Article"

The aim of this paper is to compare rates of return migration in municipalities in Sweden in order to identify regions where return migration is particularly important, and also to identify which regions are the most attractive for return migration. The empirical study is based on Swedish register data, and the results indicate that the rate of return migration varies considerably between regions; some are more attractive for return migration, yet return migrants might be most significant in the regions that attract few other migrants.

The point of departure in the study, based on policy documents, fieldwork and interviews with local actors involved in the implementation of the INTERREG initiatives, is that spatial identity is not a feature that regions have but something that is actively performed.

However, the inherent lack of input-orientated democratic legitimacy in governance institutions has only recently come to the forefront of research. In the present article, the democratic deficit of metropolitan governance is investigated with respect to the role of the municipal councillors and their inclusion in such institutions. The objects of study are local councillors in Swiss metropolitan areas, where regional cooperation is traditionally organised in functional associations that correspond to the flexible, informal logic of governance networks. The impact of metropolitan governance on the councillors’ political influence and on their behavioural patterns is assessed on the basis of large-scale survey data and comprehensive multilevel analyses accounting for the multilevel system of Swiss federalism.",Local democracy;metropolitan governance;municipal councillors;new regionalism,"Research Article"

Drawing on awider longitudinal study, the paper focuses on the lived experiences of 39 migrants from EU Member States living in Ireland. Focusing on domains of integration, we explore the different pathways by which EU migrants move to Ireland and become part of Irish society. Cultural and social pathways – including language, study, adventure and social relationships – are important as the original motivation for migration. Contrary to popular perception, economic factors such as employment were mostly seen as enabling social and cultural interests. However, economic but also social pathways came to the fore during the recession, when securing one’s livelihood and networks took on a new importance. We show that migrants developed various tactics to intensify their contact with Irish society and to develop feelings of being ‘at home’, despite a deteriorating economic situation. Despite these individual efforts, EU migrants continue to face obstacles to integration in Ireland: obstacles that need to be acknowledged at addressed within Ireland and across the EU more broadly.",European Union;integration;Ireland;migration,"Research Article"

These trends have major impacts on the countryside in general. These profound changes within both the agricultural sector and society are not simple and distinct processes, but are often complex and reciprocal. In this research we try to unravel this complex and reciprocal relationship by focussing on the production factor land and the bond that the individual farmer as well as the farming community has with it. More specifically, we want to provide insight in the way changes in land use and transformations of the countryside are acknowledged and evaluated among the farming community. In order to do this we propose a methodology which combines in-depth interviews with focus group discussions centred around visualized spatial data. This method allows us to get a better understanding of the perception farmers have of land and the value they attach to it. It also provides us with a better insight into the less visible changes in the social fabric of the countryside (such as the apparent tensions between retired and active farmers, tensions between part-time and fulltime farmers and the suspicion of traditional farmers towards multifunctional farmers).",Contested countryside;production factor land;qualitative research;rural change;spatial transformations,"Research Article"

This paper examines the experience of translating the new Directive into practical policy-making in the Douro River Catchment in the north of Portugal. Regional development and the evolution of water management are initially described, which then inform the assessment of the achievements and failures of the new regulatory regime. The higher level of concern for environmental impacts and the integration of responses that follow the WFD can be identified as positive steps in the direction of resolving lasting water management problems. However, the translation of the Directive into national legislation has also reinforced techno-bureaucratic practices and politico-economic centralisation, as well as led to various forms of contestation and protest. It is suggested that two main reasons account for those difficulties: the sociospatial rigidity (i.e. the fragmented and static understanding of ecological and social interactions) and the monotonic categorisation of water management issues (i.e. upfront decisions with limited scope for innovation and creativity at the local level). Overall, the success of the WFD seems to depend fundamentally on the ability to perceive the broader socionatural complexity of water management and on the pursuit of more effective forms of negotiation and social inclusion.",Water Framework Directive;environmental regulation;economic instruments;regional development;water conflicts,"Research Article"

These are the only regions in Portugal which converge towards the European average growth rate with respect to gross production, investment and employment creation. It is now timely to evaluate firms’ contributions to national and regional growth, their obstacles, and impacts. After a conceptualization of innovation policy in Portugal, the present paper treats innovation as a major criterion for the policy evaluation process referred to above. Our empirical investigation aims to explain the innovation performance of Portuguese firms throughout the country, and to explore those determinants of innovation which are region-specific. Therefore, the analysis addresses a set of firms’ achievement patterns, by focusing on ways in which institutions interact in the process of innovation at the regional level. In our modelling study, we employ a new methodology, viz. the external logistic biplot method, which is applied to an extensive sample of innovative institutions in Portugal. Variables identified as crucial determinants in earlier studies are used to describe regional institutional profiles. Such profiles exhibit a great variety of ways in which these determinants are able to promote regional innovation. The creation of a Gradient of Capacity to Dynamically Innovate associated with each firm enables an analysis of the innovation gradient of each region in Portugal.

Focusing empirically on Bicocca (a post-industrial area north-east of Milan that traditionally hosted the activities of Pirelli, one of Italy’s most successful companies), the paper shifts the focus of enquiry on land financialization from global capital flows and real estate aggregate data to a qualitative analysis of the alliances and struggles between the elites and workers who animated the traditional manufacturing sector. Centring the analysis on these previously neglected actors permits an understanding of land financialization as a ‘lived’ and socially embodied process, and offers a complementary perspective to the discussion on the role of land rent in the making of financialized capitalism. First, it reveals the struggles and alliances between industrial elites, workers’ unions, and local governance as key protagonists in the way land became mobilized as a financial asset, was subsequently embedded in practices of urban renewal, and finally contributed to an epochal change in urban capitalism. Second, it shows how mobilizing industrial land as a financial asset performed not just a coordinating but also a transformative role in the transition from industrial to financial capitalism as it enabled traditional elites to launch into a financialized phase of transnational competition. Third, it reveals changes in urban governance to be as much responses to the needs of local traditional elites as they are responses to the demands of global financial elites.",Capital switch;governance;industrial elites;land;financialization;land rent;Milan;Pirelli;real estate;urban transitions;workers’ unions;imaginary,"Research Article"

However, the question of whether closed-circuit television (CCTV) actually promotes experiences of safety is neither straightforward nor resolved. Although this topic has received substantial attention in the academic literature, relatively little research has been conducted on how users of public spaces perceive CCTV whilst in the midst of situations. By directly confronting study participants in the presence of CCTV cameras, we explore nightlife district visitors’ perceptions and understandings of CCTV in situ, in relation to safety when out at night in Utrecht and Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Potential differences regarding gender and ethnicity are also considered. We found, first, that our study participants’ awareness of CCTV during the practice of ‘going out’ was a continuum rather than a dichotomy (aware or unaware) and that fuller awareness of CCTV is related to greater personal safety. Second, we observed a large gap between the policy discourses surrounding CCTV and the understanding of nightlife district visitors regarding how CCTV works. It is suggested that one way of aligning visitors’ understanding and policy discourses is to shift the latter from a focus on ensuring safety towards offering assistance. For the delivery of such assistance in practice, CCTV needs to be integrated further with other forms of policing and surveillance, especially those forms that are compatible with a spatiotemporal logic of embodiment and situatedness.",Awareness;CCTV;lived experience;nightlife districts;night-time economy;urban night,"Research Article"

However, governmental steering has been vague on most sensitive and pragmatic land use policy issues such as planning and policy tools to control dispersed development patterns leading to urban sprawl. This article examines the challenges of consistent steering of land use practices by presenting observations from follow-up studies of five Finnish urban regions, all in the first stage of implementing the PARAS Act. The analysis reveals that mixed messages and defensive routines are preventing effective political debate on core issues. These defences are fostered by the vagueness of central government policy.

Starting from analysis of the application and delivery of Leader under the present Rural Development Programme in two EU countries, Austria and Ireland, this paper presents an assessment of the effects of this programme change. In addition, it includes the EU-wide discussion on the (limited) effectiveness of the current implementation of Leader and the search for a reorientation towards local development activities in the EU’s reform proposals. The paper frames the analysis around the notion of social innovation, a concept of central importance to the aims of Leader.

According to recent studies, almost 42 per cent of all large European cities are currently shrinking. In eastern Europe, shrinking cities have formed the overwhelming majority – here, three out of four cities report a decrease in population. Shrinkage has proved to be a very diverse and complex phenomenon. In our understanding, a considerable and constant loss of population by an urban area classifies it as a shrinking city. So, while the indicator of shrinkage used here is rather simple, the nature of the process and its causes and consequences for the affected urban areas are multifaceted and need to be explained and understood in further detail. Set against this background, the article presents, first, urban shrinkage as both spatially and temporally uneven. Second, this article shows that the causes of urban shrinkage are as varied as they are numerous. We explore the ‘pluralist world of urban shrinkage’ in the European Union and beyond. The article provides an original process model of urban shrinkage, bringing together its causes, impacts and dynamics, and setting them in the context of locally based urban trajectories. The main argument of this arrticle is that there is no ‘grand explanatory heuristics’ of shrinkage; a ‘one-size-fits-all’ explanatory approach to shrinkage cannot deliver. To progress and remain relevant, one ought to move away from outcome-orientated towards process-orientated research on urban shrinkage.",Comparative research;Europe;local trajectories;process model;urban shrinkage,"Research Article"

According to recent studies, almost 42 % of all large European cities are currently shrinking, the largest number of them being situated in Eastern Europe. Across Europe, shrinkage affects all types of regions; in a way, Europe has become a shrinking continent. Shrinkage is not only a problem of larger cities, but has, in fact, become one of several pathways for European urban and rural development. Given the context that the European Commission’s ambition is to create prosperous, attractive and sustainable cities, they are expected to create equilibrium between population and employment opportunities, provide clean, safe, sustainable environments and avoid social exclusion. Set against this background, the commentary discusses the challenge that urban shrinkage brings about for European policymaking. It addresses especially issues of urban governance and planning. It draws on recent research on shrinking cities across the European territory. It argues that, on the European level, knowledge about shrinking cities is required; hence, the European Commission should encourage networks of researchers and support mutual exchange between research and urban practice. It argues, too, that there is a great deal of expertise available in some European cities about how to cope with shrinkage and there are other places, throughout Europe, that are in urgent need of this expertise. It finally advocates a stronger voice for the vision of the sustainable, shrinking or shrunk city as a priority of current and future urban policy of the EU.",European cities;European policymaking;urban governance;urban shrinkage,"Research Article"

Contrary to the dominant rhetoric, austerity measures and pacts imposed on Greece, Portugal, Spain – and later Cyprus – do not seem to provide effective remedies. On the contrary, they seem to plunge entire areas and groups of people into a vicious cycle of rising unemployment, shrinking incomes and deep impoverishment. In the context of this rhetoric, an almost exclusive emphasis on the macro-economic aspects of the crisis, seems to “expel” from public debate the fact that there are effects of austerity policies that are unevenly distributed, inscribed as they are on existing inequalities: inequalities among places, between women and men, locals and migrants, big and small employers, secure and precarious workers and, most importantly, intersections of these. This paper engages with some of the less debated aspects of the crisis in Athens, with a focus on the complex and usually invisible ways in which it impacts on women. It draws upon research in a low-income neighbourhood of Athens and focuses on changes in women’s everyday lives, which have to do with job precarity and job loss, destruction of social services and the re-shaping of care, as well as practices of coping with/resisting the crisis.",Care;Greek crisis;precarity;urban neighbourhoods;women,"Research Article"

In the process, what is meant by the ‘border’ is being transformed with implications for where the border is located, who has jurisdiction over particular spaces, and how border and migration management is undertaken. This paper analyses the spatial logics of EU border externalization practices as they are being applied to and in North and West Africa. It focuses on Operation Seahorse and the transnationally coordinated border control projects and infrastructures implemented by the Guardia Civil of Spain. Seahorse serves as an implementation case of the Migration Routes Initiative, an approach toward migration management emphasizing interregional cooperation between designated origin-transit-destination countries. The initiative is the organizing strategy of the Global Approach to Migration, the EU’s overarching framework toward migration policy. The paper shows how Seahorse is changing migration policy and re-articulating Europe’s relations with African countries, producing new bordering processes, creating new geographies of integration and border management, and redefining the practices of territory, sovereignty, and extra-territoriality.",Border externalization;Euro-Med;migration;routes management;Spain,"Research Article"

In this article we argue first that the process of transformation and localisation of welfare is driven by two different (sometimes opposing) forces: (1) the necessity to identify effective ways of responding to the need for social support which is increasingly individualised, fragmented and heterogeneous, and therefore to expand ‘active’ social policies; and (2) the necessity to keep under control (and more often reducing) national public spending. Second, we argue that a more integrated welfare system (involving the third sector, voluntary organisations and private providers) and one which is more locally differentiated poses a series of problems in terms of social and territorial inequalities. We then identify some conditions that can help to keep inequalities under control.

The hotel industry is one of the most striking examples. Given that the hotel sector is much more global in terms of number of countries covered by each company than many other service industries, one of the crucial aspects of hotel sector globalisation that requires attention from a geographical perspective is the territorial embeddedness of expanding hotel groups in the variety of institutional, political and economic contexts. Grounded in the global production networks (GPNs) approach, this paper aims to address this lacuna in empirical and theoretical terms. Drawing from extensive research carried out in Poland, Estonia and Bulgaria, the paper examines the impact of post-communist transformations on the expansion of international hotel groups into Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and analyses how different hotel GPNs interact with the various contexts across the region. It is argued that the ways in which post-communist transformations influence the expansion of hotel groups into CEE depend upon the degree of territorial embeddedness of the hotel group, which, in turn, is reflective of the group’s business model and the architecture of its GPN. In theoretical terms, the paper illustrates how, to better account for the particularities of CEE, the GPN approach can incorporate the ‘alternative approach’ – the theory of post-communist transformations that challenges the neoliberal orthodoxy which drove the post-communist restructuring in the 1990s.",Central and Eastern Europe (CEE);global production networks (GPNs);post-communist transformations;the alternative approach;the international hotel industry,"Research Article"

Different models of urban dispersion have been identified during the investigated period by correlating variables such as population density, land-use and territorial characteristics to the sprawl index.

The central crux of this paper is that convergence/divergence trends in European states are conditioned by ‘state capacity’. State capacity – which we define here as a combination of impartial bureaucratic practices, corruption and the rule of law – limits, and in some cases reverses the tendency towards greater divergence linked to trade. Countries with high levels of state capacity – that is, those that have greater government effectiveness, stronger rule of law and lower corruption – experience lower levels of divergence, as they have the mechanisms to counterbalance the strong centripetal forces linked to openness. This claim is tested on countries that have experienced relatively high levels of increases in levels of economic and political globalisation – European Union (EU) member states – using aggregated regional-level data from 1995 to 2008.

The research objectives are achieved through a qualitative study of local small creative firms’ perceptions of the impacts of the Olympic Games’ cultural programme on their activities. To achieve this, Torino 2006 and London 2012 are used as case studies. The findings of this exploratory study show that cultural events can impact the creative sector. They do this by providing opportunities for mutual learning and access to initiatives that may generate ideas and new skills, as well as contributing to the development of a creative field. The study also explores the weaknesses and missed opportunities linked to the Cultural Olympiad programme, as perceived by creative practitioners. These include the lack of information and failure to engage smaller businesses. Based on qualitative analysis and discussion, recommendations for future organizers and further research are provided.",Creative field;creative industries;Cultural Olympiad;cultural sector;event legacy,"Research Article"

Although amalgamation was one of the recommended strategies, as a consequence of the European Union/International Monetary Fund bailout process, an alternative approach has been suggested. This reform is mostly a development of inter-municipal cooperation mechanisms combined with partial devolution strategies. However, as the bailout agreement was its main catalyst, the urgency to cut public administration costs required in the memorandum and the imposed deadlines gave a perverse incentive for central government to produce ad hoc and fragmented modifications. I argue that these political and economical demands, which sanctioned the argument for rushed measures, together with the country’s strong local identities, historical municipalism, political centralism and the political costs of significant territorial changes, can explain the absence of a comprehensible reform strategy and the singularities of its policies. This article explores the framework that justifies the reform and assesses the impacts of the bailout agreement.",Bailout;devolution policy;governance;local government;Portugal;reform,"Research Article"

Entities developed to foster cross-border cooperation, such as working communities and Euroregions, are conceived as mechanisms of democratisation through the decentralisation of regional or/and local governmental bodies. However, scholarly debate suggests that the top-down policy-making process that is characteristic of cross-border programmes seems to cast doubt on the fulfilment of a European participatory democracy. In this respect, the cross-border cooperation process seems to contribute an added value to the dilemma of the European democratic deficit. The objective of this paper is to present a regional contribution to this debate through a study of local experts’ perspectives on the implementation and impact of cross-border cooperation policies in the southern Portugal–Spain border region and the possibilities for local and social participation. This paper utilises data from two related investigations in the southern cross-border area between Portugal and Spain, including qualitative interviews, focus groups and content analysis of secondary data. The results reveal a positive attitude towards the recent regional top-down initiatives of European integration, although local experts question the potential for the inclusion of local perspectives in cross-border initiatives. In addition, during this period of economic crisis, political contradictions may be observed, and political initiatives related to the Spanish–Portuguese border may hamper the existing cross-border flows and dynamics of progressive integration. In this sense, local authorities play an important role as the nexus between transnational institutions of cross-border cooperation and the inhabitants of border regions.",Cross-border cooperation;democratic deficit;European integration;Euroregion;local/social participation;regionalism,"Research Article"

Overviews of post-socialist transformation can conflate daily informal payments to bureaucrats made by citizens with high-level political corruption. Micro-study analyses frame informal payments within a binary of ex-ante ‘insurance’ or ex-post ‘gratitude’, embedded within an economistic transactional frame. In contrast, this article takes a ‘social function’ approach, examining transactions for what they reveal about parties’ evaluations of personhood, both of the giver and receiver. Street-level bureaucrats and citizens engage in socially grounded negotiation whereby payment is assessed within a needs–means spectrum. The more needy, the smaller the payment; the greater the means, the greater the payment. This is an efficacy-affective form of redistribution and welfare functioning against a backdrop of the dysfunctional state’s refusal to act as social welfare guarantor. It reveals a degree of structuring from below of the qualitative intervention by the state in the lives of citizens, even as distrust and despair in post-socialist societies due to the retreat of the state from its duties towards citizens reach ever higher levels.",Corruption;informal payments;moral economy;personhood;Russia;Ukraine,"Research Article"

It argues that understanding this type of cross-border co-operation requires a focus on the way in which professionals define and apply their professional standards in cross-border contexts. Moreover, it requires a focus on individual organizations and professionals working in them, rather than ‘government’ or ‘the state’ as a whole, since cross-border co-operation in these areas typically develops as a result of disparate and unconnected initiatives taken by governmental actors in a given border region. Based on four studies of cross-border co-operation in Dutch border regions, we argue that differences in legal, organizational and cultural backgrounds between the participating countries can be and are overcome by street-level professionals and their organizations, who act as ‘regionauts’ in exploring opportunities for cross-border co-operation. In this type of ‘bottom-up’ cross-border co-operation, motivation among participants is the key to establishing co-operation, and solutions to differences between work routines will be developed along the way. As a result, the establishment of cross-border co-operation often is an experimental, pragmatic enterprise, which is greatly affected by local intra- and inter-organizational dynamics. This opens the potential for pragmatic, flexible and creative solutions. Yet, at the same time it also runs the risk of producing unaccountable cross-border arrangements that are insufficiently embedded in legal and professional safeguards against error and abuse.",Cross-border co-operation;cross-border governance;European Union;professionals;regionauts;soft spaces,"Research Article"

In order to address this gap, this article highlights the experiences of female Russian immigrant entrepreneurs living in Finnmark in northernmost Norway. Finnmark in fact represents a particularly interesting geographical context for such an empirical focus. The article considers how social, economic and cultural contexts configure network relationships and reveals the important role of the family, and in particular the male spouse, representing a network of resources that may alleviate migrant disadvantage through affective ties. Moreover, it shows that the family of the immigrant entrepreneurs may be located both locally in the new context of settlement and transnationally in the country of origin, and in addition may be of both co-ethnic and cross-ethnic character.",Bonding and bridging;family embeddedness;immigrant female entrepreneurship;local and transnational;rural context;social networking;spousal support,"Research Article"

Recent debates on policy mobilities opened a fruitful discussion on how policies are transferred from one place to another and the complex processes that rework places and policies in heterogeneous ways. While we are sympathetic to this literature, there are theoretical and empirical gaps to be addressed. It is frequently stated that processes around the transfer and grounding of policies are complex, and that outcomes are far from secure. However, the empirical focus in most cases is on transfers that are more or less “successful”, or at least portrayed as being successful by their advocates. In contrast to this “success bias” in research and public discourse, we argue that it is helpful to focus more closely on failures, resistances and contradictions. Judging from work on the transfer of BIDs – an almost classical example of successfully mobilized urban policies – we argue that it is helpful to reflect on unfinished policy mobilities, that is, the failure of mobilized urban policies.",Business Improvement Districts;Germany;neoliberalism;policy mobilities;urban development,"Research Article"

There is also a problem of a paucity of research showing how foreign investment had been involved in evolutionary processes of regional economic change. The paper shows that a more complete appreciation of the role of inward investment needs to consider not only its role in job creation but also the relative stability of the investment and jobs attracted.

We have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of spatial and temporal trends in the national-scale patterns of energy poverty, as well as gas and electricity prices. The results of our work indicate that the classic economic development distinction between the core and periphery also holds true in the case of energy poverty, as the incidence of this phenomenon is significantly higher in Southern and Eastern European EU Member States.

Our findings indicate that despite a steady national employment growth, only the three metropolitan regions have fully recovered from the recession of 1990. Further, we show evidence of high levels of job creation and destruction in both declining and expanding regions and sectors, and that the creation of jobs is mainly attributable to employment growth in incumbent firms, while job destruction is primarily due to exits and micro-plants. Although the geography of resistance to crises and the ability of adaptability in the aftermath vary, our findings suggest that cohesive (i.e., with many skill-related industries) and diverse (i.e., with a high degree of unrelated variety) regions are more resilient over time. We also find that resistance to future shocks (e.g., the 2008 recession) is highly dependent on the resistance to previous crises.

To date, there is little research on how parents use urban space on family leave, although it is known that fathers stay on family leave more often in urban areas. Based on a triangulation of qualitative data on the day-to-day life of mothers and fathers on family leave, the paper argues that particular place-dependent ways of being on family leave take place in the inner city. Mixed-use pavements in many ways help mothers and fathers to cope in their new life situation and break the isolation often associated with family leave. The data also shows the importance of family-friendly public and commercial places in the city, such as playgrounds and accessible grocery shops, cafeterias and restaurants. The paper concludes that there is a need to further explore the production side of the everyday practices of parents, and how they add to city life and participate in changing cityscapes.",Families;family leave;housing;inner cities;public space,"Research Article"

This paper contributes to the understanding of the relationship between peripheralization and power by empirically testing if the notion of “powerless” peripheries holds true in the light of established theories on local power. Therefore, we refer to the Community Power Debate, especially to concepts known as the “three faces of power” and the distinction between “power over” and “power to”, which were brought forward by Urban Regime theories. We discuss two empirical cases in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, and demonstrate that peripheralization here cannot be regarded as the outcome of an intended disadvantage facilitated by powerful elites (“power over”). Rather, we highlight a number of structural constraints, which decisively limit the capacity to act and the scope for local decision-making (“power to”).

Through studies of three Norwegian cluster projects, we argue that national cluster policies, through translation of an academically vague concept, facilitate a stretching of the original definition of clusters, giving regional stakeholders leeway to integrate other theoretical rationales instead. We argue that this is not taken into account in current policies.",Cluster;cluster policy;scale;scope;stretching,"Research Article"

Against the background of economic restructuring, cities are looking for new forms of city branding. In this process, ethno-cultural diversity is increasingly regarded as an asset, leading to the branding of migrant neighbourhoods, especially those characterised by migrant economies. These agglomerations of shops, cafés and restaurants provide places of leisure and consumption for cosmopolitan urbanites. This paper shows how Berlin’s municipal politicians failed in staging ‘Chinatowns’ and ‘Asiatowns’ as ethnically branded commercial districts and argues that the Vietnamese migrants who are primarily addressed by these projects are not readily marketable by a city-branding approach. The assumed common identity of Asian migrants in Berlin and the city’s top-down municipal approach contradict the structures of the heterogeneous group of Vietnamese residents. This paper traces Berlin’s transition from a reactive to a proactive approach in the marketing of ethno-cultural diversity. My approach is to embed the Dong Xuan Centre in Berlin-Lichtenberg, a Vietnamese-run wholesale centre that was founded through Vietnamese agency, in the local discourse on Asia- and Chinatowns. The study shows that the centre’s management appears to be an active agent in the branding process of the project, modelling itself after the global brand of ‘Chinatown’. However, the centre’s vision of a place of cultural life and trade contradicts German planning laws, a conflict that has led to ongoing negotiations between the centre’s management and the district government, thereby hindering its branding.",Berlin;city branding;Chinatown;ethnic diversity;entrepreneurship;urban governance;Vietnamese,"Research Article"

This is the case for Oslo, Norway’s capital, where increasingly urban policies are designed to attract transnational companies and those in the creative class. A key strategy to achieve this has been to transform the city’s waterfront through spectacular architecture and urban design, as has taken place in other European cities. Transnational and local architects have been commissioned to design the Barcode, one of the most striking waterfront projects. This article investigates the role of architecture and architects in this process, because architects can be seen as influential generators of urban spaces and agents for social change, and because there is remarkably little published empirical research on this specific role of architects. It is argued that although there was an overall planning goal that the projects along the waterfront of Oslo should contribute to social sustainability, with the implication that planners and architects possessed information about the local urban context and used this knowledge, in practice this was not the case. It is demonstrated that the architects paid little attention to the social, cultural and economic contexts in their design process. Rather, the architects emphasized the creation of an exciting urban space and, in particular, designed spectacular architecture that would contribute to the merits of the firms involved. It is further argued that because of this the Barcode project will not contribute to the making of a just city.",Architecture;urban design;urban entrepreneurialism;urban planning;waterfront transformation,"Research Article"

This study generates insights into artists’ own views of gentrification processes within the gentrifying bohemia of the Ouseburn Valley in Newcastle upon Tyne in the North East of England. We stress that gentrification in this area cannot solely be understood as a process of displacement, but is also clearly linked to the growth of modes of regulation and commercialisation within social space. Increasing regulation, brought about by greater local state focus on ‘creative districts’, has impacted the Valley. Alongside this, projects of property development as well as a general growth in the popularity of the Valley as a nightlife consumption district and area of production for commercially-orientated creative class workers have challenged artists’ values of the area as a ‘secret garden’ where romantically inflected values of self-expression, autonomy, spontaneity and non-instrumental artist cooperation can be found.",Artists;commercialisation;gentrification;Newcastle upon Tyne;regulation,"Research Article"

It is widely argued that there is a growing dissonance between the policy narratives and agendas found in metropolitan cities and amongst national governments. The former are characterised as being more pragmatic, tolerant and open in their approaches than the latter who, in many instances, have adopted more assimilationalist and nationalist rhetorics and policies. In exploring these governance dynamics, the paper builds on the work of Delanty to argue for a methodological approach grounded in what he terms critical cosmopolitanism, or a focus on the dynamic interactions between global and local influences on governmentalities and policy priorities. Much of the writing on critical cosmopolitanism has focused on questions of identity. This paper expands the concept and assesses its applicability to understandings and interpretations of urban politics and governance, through the lens of diversity narratives and the ways in which they are ‘fixed’ to broader political projects by regimes in different contexts. It argues that a range of meanings are being attached to ‘diversity’. In some instances, the term acts as a focus for more progressive forms of intervention. In others, however, it is being used to justify divisive forms of growth politics or acts as a lightning rod for existing discontents. The paper concludes by reflecting on the impacts of recent anti-globalisation and immigration politics across Europe and the fragility of existing fixes and policy assumptions.",Cosmopolitanism;diversity;governance;regimes;urban policy,"Research Article"

Due to increasing regionalism efforts within European Union (EU) member states and to the fact that EU legislation is affecting subnational authorities more and more directly, these authorities are not only striving for influence in the national arena, but in the European arena as well. The primary task of a public affairs (PA) practitioner working for a regional government in the EU is placing regional interests on national and European political agendas. However, since regional PA is a rather young discipline, opposite to PA in the private sector and in national government, much is unknown about the way regional PA practitioners are operating in the national and European political arenas, and how these arenas are receiving the subnational PA practitioners. In this study, 41 Dutch PA practitioners and PA receivers were interviewed about their opinions on and experiences with regional PA in both arenas: What are the relevant characteristics of these arenas for regional PA activities, and how are regional PA practitioners managing arena characteristics? The results show that at the national level, it is a struggle to find recognition for regional issues, due to dominant high-profiled regions, centralisation tendencies at the national level and a more general non-subnational attitude. At the European level, regional issues are more welcome, but regional PA practitioners have to overcome the dominant national interests of member states.",Arena characteristics;arena interaction;regional policy;regional public affairs,"Research Article"

We present, firstly, the EU Quarter as a fixed setting for policy making with a relatively constant physical, locational and functional shape, and a specific sense of place as the EU bubble. Secondly, we emphasise the fragmentation and fluidity that portray it as a place divided into various political assemblages that make the place an assemblage of assemblages consisting of smaller and constantly evolving sub-processes. Thirdly, we aim to demonstrate the mobile and geographically distributed nature of EU policy making, and thus the dispersal of the political places where it takes place. This generates mobility of different kinds, which include not only the circulation of political ideas and people between different sites of the EU political system, but also the monthly migration of the Parliament and related lobbyists to Strasbourg. We believe that these three aspects of political place help the understanding of the situated but simultaneously spatially dispersed and mobile nature of EU policy making, and the study of the political places in other urban contexts.",Political place;EU policy;Brussels;political assemblages;fluid space,"Research Article"

However, for city-regions, knowledge is often a scarce resource due to the small size of the policy community, context-specific issues, limited availability of resources and experts, as well as the challenge of addressing complex issues that are often supra-local. This paper explores which patterns of local knowledge promote policy change and learning. Starting from the ‘policy paradigm’ concept, a cognitive–evolutionary approach is applied to analyse Brussels’ water management policy, which aims to address the major challenge of flooding. The variety of knowledge by local actors, the role of the policy paradigm of the local policymaking community in vetting information and evaluating alternative solutions, and the importance of local governments for retaining knowledge, are the main dimensions to understanding policy change and learning. City-regions benefit from direct contacts between actors facilitating exchange of knowledge, while supra-local decisions (e.g. EU directives) and local accidents can also trigger major changes. Based on my findings, policymakers tend to rely on technocratic patterns using already available knowledge, mainly whether decentralisation reshapes the policymaking community. While a technocratic pattern determines only minor changes and institutional instability undermines policy learning, policy entrepreneurs and participative patterns can promote major changes and learning if they are able to engage in dialogue with the dominant policy paradigm.",Policy change and learning;knowledge;policy paradigm;Brussels;water;decentralisation;policymaking;city-region,"Research Article"

Particularly in terms of intellectual property rights (IPR), however, little is known about how cities contribute to regional innovation: are they containers, facilitators or innovators? This is investigated here through empirical material derived from 27 interviews with top departmental management in three Finnish cities (Helsinki, Espoo and Vantaa). The results show that local city governments (LCGs) consider cities as facilitators of innovation activities but also admit that there are limits (time constraints and lack of resources) to the influence of LCGs over the innovation environment. Still, many of the public sector innovations (especially social innovations) that do not necessarily have a clear market potential would not have been created without the active role of LCGs as innovators. City employees are innovative – the seeming lack of public sector innovation is actually a result of measurement issues that favour (patentable) technological innovations rather than those more common to LCGs, meaning service and organisational types. Therefore, LCGs can be seen as highly innovative organisations. There are, however, barriers to innovation in the public sector, such as the cost of innovation activity, the lack of incentives for it and a working culture that does not support it. Lastly, the results show that LCGs have not really fully considered the possibilities and potential of owning their own IPR; to be specific, potentially lucrative opportunities should be explored.",Innovation;intellectual property rights;local government;patents;public sector,"Research Article"

Gentrification is a travelling concept with lingering attachments to the Anglo-American urban context. Three issues related to gentrification’s global reach are discussed in this paper. The first is the definition of gentrification. The simple definition adopted by the current gentrification research agenda leads us to accept gentrification’s global reach literally by definition. The second issue is the question of contextual boundaries. Boundaries that are too broad and ill-defined – such as the metropolis of the Global North versus the metropolis of the Global South – conceal what contextual difference may be about. The third issue is the reification of cultural differences, which may lead to them being used to explain attitudes towards gentrification, even though such attitudes could be explained by more prosaic socioeconomic motives compatible with Western rationalism. This paper concludes that the metamorphoses of gentrification through its different waves in the Anglophone world do not provide the script for understanding other cities’ urban histories and making sense of their urban restructuring processes. These cities must realize that new processes emerging under increasingly neoliberal policy orientations are regressive compared with previous arrangements, especially when they tend to exclude political alternatives.

Relatively long established and formal inter-urban networks of professionals of one sort or another have been joined by activists, consultants, financiers, lawyers and think tankers who have involved themselves in the arriving at, and making up of, urban policy. Through conferences, documents, knowledge banks, policy tourism, power-points and webinars, an emergent informational infrastructure has emerged to shape and structure the circulations and making of policy-making across a numbers of areas. From aging to creativity, climate change to drugs, education to transport, urban policies in different spheres have been rendered mobile. There is political work of adaptation, mediation and translation that has to be done to move policies from one location to another, of course. In some cases these policies appear in a range of locations, while in others they do not, a reminder – if one was needed – that those involved in the making up of policy are not always able to render all elements of the future under their control.

The introduction briefly summarizes conceptualizations of ‘neighbourhood’ provided by the individual contributions that connect the realm of high politics with that of communities and individuals who are affected by and negotiate the EU’s Mediterranean borders. Specifically, three cases of socio-spatial imaginaries that exemplify patterns of differential inclusion of the ‘non-EU’ will be explored. The cases involve Italy–Tunisia cross-border relations, the EU’s post-‘Arab Spring’ engagement with civil society actors and the case of Northern Cyprus. The authors suggest that ‘neighbourhood’ can be conceptualized as a borderscape of interaction and agency that is politically framed in very general terms but that in detail is composed of many interlinked relational spaces.

In directing attention to EU readings of and responses to the ‘Arab Spring’, we indicate how both a simplification of the issues at stake and highly selective political framings of local civil societies have operated in tandem.

EU support for South Mediterranean civil society appears to be targeted at specific actors with whom the EU deems it can work: apart from national elites these include well-established, professionalized non-governmental organizations, and westernized elements of national civil societies. As a result, recognition of the heterogeneous and multilocal nature of the uprisings, as well as their causes, has only marginally translated into serious European Neighbourhood Policy reform. We suggest that an inclusive focus on civil society would reveal Neighbourhood as a contact zone and dialogic space, rather than a project upon which the EU is (rather unsuccessfully) attempting to superimpose a unifying narrative of EU-led modernization.",Arab Spring;civil society;Eurocentrism;European Neighbourhood Policy;Mediterranean;spatial imaginaries,"Research Article"

Much literature has critically analysed the EU enlargement process, underlining its imperialistic features and its problematic nature. At the same time, scholars have highlighted the EU’s difficulties in acting as a political actor and its impact on situations of ethno-national conflict. This article brings together these critical aspects by analysing them in the peculiar context of Cyprus. It retraces the negotiation process and the Turkish Cypriots’ in/visibility throughout it, and presents research conducted following Cyprus’s accession in three different periods between 2008 and 2015. We propose an interpretation of Northern Cyprus as an ‘inner neighbour’ of the EU, because of its anomalous and liminal status, the suspended application of the acquis communautaire, the unresolved conflict and the ambiguity of the border management of the Green Line, the line of partition between north and south. All these problematic features of Northern Cyprus’s situation are examined in detail to identify the unique position of this entity within the EU. In addition to this, and supporting the importance of a bottom-up understanding of the EU’s normative and symbolic projection, the article presents the opinions of Turkish Cypriot citizens about their expectations before and after 2004, and how their ideas and imaginaries related to the EU have evolved and interacted with the process of Europeanisation.",Cyprus accession process;Cyprus conflict;European Union actorness;European Union enlargement;imaginaries;Turkish Cypriots,"Research Article"

In both cases, the observed events aimed to de-stigmatise the broader urban districts in which they were staged, as well as to enhance a vibrant urban life in relatively disadvantaged areas. In the study, we identify three different ways in which these events make the public character of everyday life visible, and even redefine patterns of urban civility. The main argument deriving from our comparative ethnography is that the salience of events in the everyday life that they supposedly disrupt can be analytically addressed by developing a pragmatist approach to public space, discussing it in terms of territorial complexity.",Ethnography;everyday life;pragmatism;public space;urban events,"Research Article"

It revisits the key austerity periods noted in the country since accession to the European Union (1981), and marks their impact in redefining central–local relations, amidst a broader rescaling endeavour. A direct link is identified between austerity-oriented pre-occupations and the introduction of territorial regulatory experimentations that rest heavily on local-level collaboration and competitiveness. The overall record of partnerships, however, has been appraised, up until recently, as underdeveloped. From this spectrum, we look at the latest re-organization of state spatial contour (2010). The influence of this rescaling attempt on local relational attributes is explored in Athens, in light of the emergent re-shuffling in the scalar balance of power rendering austerity pre-occupations a firm trait of the emerging regulatory arrangement. Examination focuses on key social policy programmes launched recently by the City in an attempt to ameliorate extreme poverty and social despair. In Athens, it is argued, a financially and regulatorily deprivileged local authority is opening up to the influence of corporate and third sector organizations. It adopts a partnership approach that is best understood as a form of ‘elite pluralism’, undermining local political agency and falling short in addressing social deprivation.",Austerity;collaboration;governance;rescaling;social policy,"Research Article"

However, the recent proliferation of urban gardening in other geographies, such as southern Europe in the aftermath of the economic crisis of 2007–2008, remains underexplored. The economic crisis put on hold urban developments in many southern European cities, leaving idle plots of land waiting to be urbanized. The crisis also triggered radical political demands, such as those of the Indignados, as well as fuelling narratives revolving around social entrepreneurship and social innovation. Barcelona emerges as a laboratory of urban gardening initiatives in vacant lots mobilizing either radical urban demands or embedding new post-crisis rhetoric around social entrepreneurship. Through a combination of qualitative methods, including participant observation, a literature review, semi-structured interviews, informal conversations and field diaries, we present a characterization and evolution of the three most prominent urban gardening initiatives in the city of Barcelona (including 54 gardens at the end of 2016): the Network of Municipal Gardens (municipally led gardens for retired people); the Network of Communitarian Gardens (social movements); and the Empty Plots Plan (social entrepreneurial urban gardening). Subsequently, we discuss the different meanings of gardening in crisis/post-crisis Barcelona as well as the urban politics that each initiative articulates. Our results show that urban gardens within the city are an expression of different and non-exclusive meanings that explicitly or implicitly, in a context of crisis and post-crisis, mobilize notions of political gardening.",Allotments;community gardens;political gardening;social entrepreneurship;urban agriculture;vacant urban land,"Research Article"

Although policy agendas follow certain common trends ‘to deal with’ the consequences of diversity, there is a lack of evidence-based research on how representations of diversity are mobilised and implemented by institutions of governance operating at multiple scales and how these narratives relate to each other. Policy-makers are faced with new dilemmas over how to govern and manage cities that are becoming increasingly diverse, on the one hand, and increasingly ‘sensitive’ to certain channels of flows of people (such as refugees), on the other. In some cases, city authorities promote the idea of inclusive diversity as a mark of modernisation and tolerance. In others, its recognition may be seen as a threat to an imagined social order and is perceived to be fuelling neo-assimilationist policies in many European Union cities. This special issue aims to fill this gap by providing evidence-based research outcomes that tackle different dimensions of the governance of diversity in cities. The principal aim of the research project, named DIVERCITIES, that underpins this collection was to critically assess evidence concerning the range of socio-economic outcomes that may emerge from the presence of greater urban diversity. DIVERCITIES has shown that city policy agendas across Europe are often more ‘positive’ towards diversity than national policies and media reports. Moreover, local policy initiatives, mostly formed at the bottom-up scale, sometimes as a cooperation between state and civic actors and sometimes as purely private or even individual arrangements, address the actual needs of certain population groups by acting as bridge-builders between public authorities and target groups. This collection aims to provide a clear understanding of how diversity is understood, operationalised and dealt with at different scales of policy-making.

The starting point of our analysis is the conceptualization of multiculturalism as a set of institutional arrangements for ethnic minority group representation and recognition. While scholars have largely focused on normative critiques of multiculturalism, arguing that it is unable to respond to the super-diversity in contemporary cities, this article focuses on the empirical complexities of diversity policy-making in a local context. More specifically, we investigate the changes in the policy practices and discourses regarding the representation and recognition of ethnic minorities in Antwerp, the largest city of the Flemish Region in Belgium. The minority policies in Antwerp had taken a multicultural turn by the 1990s, most evident in two strategies for group representation and recognition: the establishment of a migrant council to address the interests of ethnic minorities and the recruitment of an ethnically diverse city staff. We analyse how these measures became contested in the context of a wider backlash against multiculturalism. When multicultural policies became diversity policies, the migrant council was disbanded and a dress code prohibited minorities from displaying religious or other symbols in front-office public functions. With these cases, we argue that diversity discourses can be politicized in the governance of cities, with far-reaching consequences, such as the demise of ethnic minority representation and recognition, eventually reinforcing a neo-assimilationist focus urging migrants and their descendants to adapt to the cultural majority.",Diversity;ethnic groups;minority recognition;minority representation;multiculturalism;urban policies,"Research Article"

In the French context, however, urban policies have mainly been implemented following an income-based definition of population diversity that does not formerly acknowledge ‘ethnicity’, by contrast to other countries such as the UK. How do French urban policies adapt to the challenge of the increased diversification of urban populations considering they do not take into consideration ethnicity, to begin with? Do they simply ignore the ethnic dimension of urban life or do they find ways to address it? In this article, we analyse the ways in which French urban policies deal with the diversification of urban populations through the scope of equality, without recognizing ethnic difference. We take the example of Paris as a highly diverse but also divided city, in terms of income and nationality of origin. Based on a critical analysis of public policy documents and interviews with key stakeholders, we highlight the paradox of dealing with diversity in a colour-blind context: the focus on socio-economic characteristics makes it difficult to consider the intersectional dimension of inequalities.",Diversity;governance;neighbourhood policies;Paris;social-mixing,"Research Article"

In fact, the question as to whether socially meaningful borders are created through state-society and systemic relations or whether they ultimately emerge locally out of social relations is not as trivial as it might seem. The concept of ‘bordering’ implies non-finalizable processes in which socio-spatial distinction is constantly created, confirmed and challenged. Far from being solely a product of state territoriality and international relations, borders are also social institutions that are constantly created, maintained and re-created as a means of negotiating the complexities of everyday life. Urban contexts reveal much about the rationales and mechanisms behind bordering processes. Our concrete bordering focus is related to place and to place-making processes that reflect the attributions, appropriations and representations of place ideas. As is argued in this paper, urban borders are a nexus between everyday practices of differentiating social space, the instrumentality of place-making, for example, as a project of urban development, and the ontological need for a sense of rootedness in place. Two case studies of urban change in Budapest and Berlin will be developed that illustrate this nexus.",Berlin;bordering;borders;Budapest;place;place-making,"Research Article"

As a result the specificity of the West European case tends to be lost. In contrast with the USA, the West European instance is very different indeed. Although there have been changes since the postwar golden years of urban and regional planning, central government remains crucial in the structuring of local and regional development and has given expression to counter-posed class forces: regional policy was historically an aspect of the welfare state as promoted by the labor movement, while urbanization policy has been much more about the forces of the political right. In the USA, by contrast, local governments and to a lesser degree, the states, have been and continue to be supreme; in contrast to Western Europe, location tends to be much more market-determined, with local and governments acting as market agents. Class forces have seemingly been much weaker, territorial coalitions occupying the center ground. As a first cut, these differences have to do with state structure: the Western European state is far more centralized, facilitating the implementation of policies that are relatively indifferent to local specificity, while in the USA the converse applies.

Relatively little attention has been given to networks in smaller cities, which is the concern of this paper. Drawing on detailed research in a small Scottish city, the paper explores how its local network was characterised by strong reliance on network construction and reproduction through trust and reputation. Significantly, within such local networks, competition and collaboration can exist side by side, without subsuming normal tensions into consistent agendas or formally defined ‘partnerships’. Controlling land for urban expansion provides a particular focus for these tensions, since it can allow certain interests to gain network dominance. These findings raise important concerns around whether small cities should rely on informal networks to promote growth instead of constructing formal coalitions that may attract more externally based actors. Such choices have profound implications for the capacity and transparency of development networks, and thus for the accountability of the urban development process.",Development networks;growth coalitions;real estate development;urban governance;urban growth;urban regimes,"Research Article"

Based on 36 stakeholder interviews and desk research, this paper does so through an analysis of how the Martim Moniz square, in Lisbon, became the city’s first square under private management in 2012. To do so, the paper goes through the local governance context and the importance of convivial public spaces as a political objective, leading to regular partnerships with non-state actors. The square is adjacent to Mouraria, a derelict neighbourhood that was a testing ground for the city’s new urban policies. The square’s private management scheme – branded the Mercado de Fusão – rather than a rupture with existing practices, is the result of a coincidence of interests of both actors. Moreover, it reassembles typical local policy responses and the company’s expertise in a unitary management scheme. The seamless implementation of the Mercado is made possible by the pre-existing relationship between the company and the municipality. The paper thus shows that there is no fundamental shift towards private governance in Lisbon. Rather, it is the generalized commodification of public spaces resulting from the emergence of conviviality as a political objective that opened up the conditions for the square’s privatization. The relationship between conviviality as a political objective and privatization is presented as a promising subject for further research.",Convivial urbanism;Lisbon;privatization;public space;public space governance,"Research Article"

Informed by empirical research on smart city policies in Hungary and the Netherlands, this paper argues that the policy mobilities approach tends to overemphasize the global and the local. Notwithstanding the transnational circulation of smart city ideas, the national scale continues being reproduced by these ideas as a relevant scale of urban regulation, discursive framing and strategy-making under globalization. To acknowledge this, and to move towards a more decidedly multiscalar perspective on actually existing smart urbanisms, it is suggested that we incorporate the national scale, understood as a relational set of practices and discourses, more explicitly into our analysis. Insights from the Hungarian and Dutch case studies are used to illustrate the manifold ways in which the local embedding of the globally mobile smart city concept is shaped by the national scale, as well as how the national itself is being renegotiated in this process.",Multiscalar;national scale;policy mobilities;scale debate;smart city;urban policy,"Research Article"

The paper takes a comparative approach, analysing the evolution of urban policy and Europeanization in four member states: France, Italy, Spain and the UK from the 1990s up to the current Cohesion Policy period (2014–2020). Using an analytical framework based on three dimensions of Europeanization (direction, object and impact), we examine the extent to which urban policies are moving towards an integrated approach to sustainable urban development, as supported by the EU. The paper highlights the contradictions between processes of convergence through Europeanization, and path-dependent systems and trajectories that forge alternative paths. In doing so, it advances wider debates on the impact of Europeanization in a neo-liberal context by arguing that member states more likely to be affected by Europeanization are those most impacted by national austerity measures. A process of ‘variegated Europeanization’ is proposed to capture the differential practices taking place within the EU with regard to the circulation of the EU’s approach to urban policy.",Europeanization;urban policy;policy mobility;urban agenda;policy transfer,"Research Article"

The public sector constitutes one of the main categories of large landowners, although this type of ownership takes more than one form, due to the wide variety of public sector bodies holding property. Public land management became one of the focuses of austerity policies in many European countries after the burst of economic crisis in 2008–2009, externally imposed in those countries that went through bailout programmes. In Greece, the history of land policy shows that a fundamental objective of state policy was the distribution and liquidation of public land, a policy that contributed to the formation of an extensive system of small land ownership. From 2010 onwards, a plethora of formal legislation sought to accelerate development procedures for the remaining large-scale public property, as a background resource to attract large-scale, so-called “strategic”, investments. This paper explores the critical characteristics and outcomes of the reforms to transform public land policy, identifying the interactions with urban planning, before and during the economic crisis. Taking a longer temporal view, the paper highlights the entrenched relationships existing between public land policy, urban planning and property development processes and their significance in the diachronic continuities often concealed in major policy reversals and reforms. It argues that ultimately there is a lack of a coherent and sustainable public property valorisation policy, being deprived of any institutional innovation for new forms of urban development, as well as of social acceptance.",Economic crisis;Greece;large-scale property development;public land policy;urban planning,"Research Article"

Using register data on all families moving out from metropolitan areas in Sweden during the period 2003–2013, we found a small but steady outflow of families, mainly to medium-sized or small towns. The highly educated are overrepresented among these families, thus providing potential for an inflow of competence to the receiving areas. Contrary to expected, the assumed flexibility in time and space among knowledge sector professionals does not seem to enable them more than others to pursue counterurban moves. Instead, public sector professionals characterise families making a counterurban move to all destination regions, while men with a profession within arts and crafts to a higher extent move with their family to more rural areas.",Competing risk;counterurban migration;counterurbanisation;event-history analysis;families;profession,"Research Article"

The findings generally show that labour flows between manufacturing and services have important bi-directional features, even with manufacturing generally declining. There is no staff exodus from manufacturing to services, but rather an exchange suggesting skill interdependencies, especially between high-tech manufacturing and KIBS. However, there are strong geographical dimensions to this, emphasising a reinforcement of the spatial division of labour patterns. In trend terms, the decline of manufacturing is rather similar across all regional types; however, business services are growing much faster in metropolitan regions. The labour flow between manufacturing and KIBS is more likely in metropolitan regions, but far more often additionally involves geographical mobility, either between or towards the metropolitan regions. Thus, the major challenge facing less dense and peripheral regions is not necessarily the decline of manufacturing per se, but that (a) the low levels of transition into business services are insufficient to make up for employment losses in manufacturing and (b) the fact that there is considerable out-migration of experienced and skilled workers from manufacturing, who are joining the growing numbers of business services in metropolitan regions.",Economic geography;labour mobility;regional divergence;relatedness;sector integration,"Research Article"

The national governments in both Italy and the UK have constructed regulatory and governance relationships to orchestrate and reorder economic, social and ecological challenges and devolve responsibilities at the sub-national level. This has offered an opportunity for the peculiarities of regional setups to be taken into account and regions have contributed towards the promotion of green and sustainable path development via the route of promoting RE deployment. The paper argues that the downscaling and distribution of responsibility in the cases investigated reflect the capacity and willingness of nation states to respond to and mediate the strategic goals and outcomes formulated at national and international levels. Nevertheless, while the regions investigated display differences in their incentives, capacities and capabilities to increase RE deployment, their ability to act is very much influenced by nation states, stressing the important role of the state in mediating the form and direction of RE deployment.",Regions;renewable energy;state;Italian regions;Wales;Scotland;eco-restructuring,"Research Article"

This perception is stronger nowadays than it was then. Quite often it is argued that, as a result of economic liberalisation and the paradigm shift from Keynesianism to Monetarism, industrial relations are under pressure, and that this is accompanied by a weakening of trade union power. In this article, the development of collective negotiations and the new contours of corporatism are analysed with respect to Germany. At the moment we are witnessing a decentralisation of formerly central negotiations and their differentiation in the direction of collective and/or concession bargaining at the level of the firm. At the same time, there is an important trend towards the up-scaling of industrial relations to the European Union level. The central argument of the article, therefore, is that a rescaling of industrial relations is taking place, which does not necessarily mean an end to corporatism but, rather, profoundly new qualities of corporatism. In order to develop the argument, changes in industrial and political organisation are examined.",Collective agreements;corporatism;industrial relations;labour geography;trade unions,"Research Article"

Results indicate that the main determinants driving them back home include the difficulty of integrating into Greek society, racism and failure to find work.

While these economic and political de-/re-territorialization processes have been studied at length, relatively little attention has been paid to the transformation of the territorial identities associated with these spaces. The aim of the present study is twofold. First, it aims to understand whether territorial identities are experiencing a similar re-scaling along with modes of economic production and forms of political governance. Second, it explores which factors today explain the attachment of people to their territories. A descriptive analysis of Eurobarometer survey data for Western Europe reveals no signs of a re-scaling of territorial identities, pointing to a sort of inertia of these identities in relation to the changing of political and economic structures.

EU cohesion policy is often credited with improving cooperation and coordination in the delivery of the regional development policy through the application of multi-level governance enshrined in the partnership principle. By imposing a close partnership among a variety of actors, cohesion policy has the capacity to alter domestic relations between the centre and the periphery, and to create a broader scope for regional and bottom-up involvement in economic development policy. However, a lack of tradition of decentralization and collaborative policy-making, as well as a limited capacity of sub-national actors, can result in uneven outcomes of the application of the partnership principle across countries and regions. This raises questions about the transferability of the partnership approach to new Member States characterized by weak sub-national institutions, a legacy of centralized policy-making and limited civic involvement. This paper addresses this issue by comparing horizontal partnership arrangements put in place for the purpose of cohesion policy implementation and examining their impacts on the patterns of sub-national governance. The horizontal partnership arrangements are compared across three regions in countries with differentiated systems of territorial administration: Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.",Central and Eastern Europe;EU cohesion policy;Europeanization;multi-level governance;partnership,"Research Article"

In parallel, the partnership principle (PP) has been introduced to guarantee the participation of social and economic actors in both decision making and implementation processes in order to better understand and respond to territorial needs. A review of existing literature identifies opposing views on the benefit of this complex architecture. This paper investigates potentially conflicting effects of MLG and the PP on political accountability, for example by blurring responsibilities and corrupting stakeholder engagements. The Italian case is used to test this hypothesis and identify bottlenecks. Initial findings suggest that the empowerment of new actors by means of MLG has had the effect of disclosing political influence from several players in the decision-making arena, therefore obscuring the accountability of the different tiers involved both vertically and horizontally. This is because actors in the governance chain might tend to shift blame of policy failure towards higher or lower governmental levels. Additionally, the engagement of stakeholders may reduce the efficiency of implementation processes both through a lack of inclusiveness in the decision and policymaking style or through a lack of competences within civil society in interpreting local needs in relation to EU cohesion policy goals. This article concludes by outlining possible solutions for cohesion policy practice to minimize the negative consequences of a multi-tier/multi-actor system.",Multi-level governance;partnership;political accountability;stakeholder engagement;cohesion policy,"Research Article"

Recently, a number of studies have focused on the implementation of the European Cohesion Policy in the new member states. They have listed the numerous obstacles to its functioning effectively. However, given the shortfalls, they were not in the position to question the entire range of effects of partnership when it does indeed work. Complementary to this approach, this paper starts from the example of a best-practice, looking at the concrete results of the use of partnership to ensure a place-based approach to regional policies. It uses the example of the East-German Land of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, a NUTS II region that benefits from structural funding under the convergence objective. After a brief description of how the partnership principle works on the ground, it examines the conditions of its success. It then analyses its contribution to “good governance”. Lastly, it examines whether this form of partnership rises to the challenge of implementing a place-based approach as defined in the Barca Report. It argues that it neither offers all individuals a chance to become informed and contribute their knowledge or express their preferences about the delivery of projects, which involve the very technical issues of regional development and the disbursement of the structural funds. Nor does it allow control and pressure on policy makers by the citizen.

It does that through the deployment of the theoretical frameworks of Multi-level Governance and the application of the principle of partnership. The principle of partnership has been an integral aspect of the regulatory framework governing the Cohesion Policy and has remained so after all the reforms of the Structural Funds. The aims of the partnership principle are mediated through domestic policy practices which, in the case of Greece, have been highly centralised. An assessment regarding the changes of governance towards greater sub-national involvement about the current programming period (2008–2013) indicates that there has hardly been any turn towards Multi-level Governance whilst the principle of partnership was only applied in a superficial way. These issues are pertinent in light of the ‘Kalikratis’ plan, which was introduced in 2010 in order to modernise the sub-national authorities, as well as the austerity measures that followed the fiscal crisis which has engulfed Greece since 2010. The interplay between the domestic territorial reforms introduced by ‘Kalikratis’, the austerity measures and the superficial patterns of internalisation of the principle of partnership has led to the rescaling of governance and to less spending, further undermining the already diminished capacities for participation by the sub-national authorities.",Austerity;Greece;‘Kalikratis’ plan;Multi-level Governance;partnership,"Research Article"

This article offers an extensive analysis of the spatial and functional allocation of public investment in Greece over a 33-year period and for various political-economic sub-periods. It examines the prevalence of criteria relating to redistribution, efficiency and equity; the temporal stability and functional complementarity of the observed allocations; and the extent of specialisation, concentration and clustering. Our results offer little evidence of regional or functional targeting, the exploitation of synergies and scale effects (efficiency), or the pursuit of objectives related to equity or redistribution. This raises serious questions about the efficacy of past public investment allocations in Greece and, with the expected increase in funding emanating from the EU, highlights the need for (re)defining the priorities and criteria for the spatial and functional allocation of public investments in the future.",Efficiency;equity;Greece;public investment;redistribution;regional allocation,"Research Article"

This paper examines the ways mega-events—with the help of capitalist boosterism rhetoric—become intertwined in regional and urban policies. Using the run-ups to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa summits as case studies (Ekaterinburg in 2009 and Ufa in 2015), I investigate local citizens’ and stakeholders’ perceptions of federal and local governmental action surrounding mega-events in Russia. Drawing on the theoretical notion of clientelism, I argue that the hidden rationality in the preparation for mega-events consists of their use by local stakeholders (1) as a legitimizing tool for raising their political and economic capital and (2) as a convenient pretext to directly and indirectly elicit benefits and amplify existing practices of rent seeking. Planners evoke neoliberal rhetorics of growth and profit-oriented investments to justify the “conversations” that various ranks of elite have among themselves.

Contrary to free market mantras, the case of the Euro reveals ‘actually existing neoliberalism’ as involving a vital role for the state, but one where statehood is stretched in different, often incompatible, directions. The configurations of deregulation and reregulation involved reveal an emergent scalar hierarchy of monopoly manipulation and collusions, the outcomes of which are new patterns of spatial differentiation. The analysis of Euro 2012 helps to piece together the contradictory features of statehood as they emerge both in relation to, and as an element actively involved in, producing this configuration. Such research is important both for a view of the further transformations of statehood in Eastern Europe and also to ask what light the evolutions of statehood in Eastern Europe, as evidenced in the organisation of Euro 2012, throw on the turbulent realignments of the international configuration currently underway, particularly in terms of an ambivalent role of the notion of Europe.",Euro 2012;mega-events;monopolies;neoliberalism;statehood;Warsaw,"Research Article"

Although the literature on the ‘mobility turn’ and the scholarship on urban policy mobilities both acknowledge the existence and importance of immobilization and immobility, immobility is under researched and relegated to a passive position. (Im)mobility is neither a thing nor a characteristic of things: a country or city are not mobile in themselves but in relation to (im)mobilization processes. By using the case of the lobbying by Perm (Russia) for the European Capital of Culture (a cultural policy and mega-event reserved for European Union member states), this paper focuses on the politics and practices of (im)mobilization and on the membership in awarding institutions as one of the factors which limit the mobilization of mega-events. Based on semi-structured interviews with key actors and archival research examining official policy documents and media accounts, the paper documents the politics, channels and practices of the mobilization of an immobile policy. The mobilization of immobile policies works by trying to overcome the constitution of policies as (im)mobile and the factors which limit mobilization, in this case the identity-building and region-building project of the European Union. The European Capital of Culture is a highly mobile policy within the European Union, which was constructed to produce ‘Europe’ as a political, economic and cultural space. The ‘role of elsewhere’ and of the informational infrastructure (reports, models, experts, consultancies, etc.) which was developed for a smoother circulation inside the geographical scope of the policy, permitted it to travel outside, and enables the creation of new policies and events modelled on an immobile policy.",European Capital of Culture;expertise;immobilities;mega-events;mobilities;politics of immobilization;Russia,"Research Article"

Starting from an urban political ecology view, the urbanization of the water cycle is understood as the mobilization of water resources to keep pace with and sustain urban growth. This process could not be understood without inquiring into the evolution of the urban fabric in both cities. At the same time an understanding of the power choreographies over the water cycle needs to be brought to the fore. In Barcelona, disputes between the municipality and private capital over the water monopoly deeply shaped the trajectory of the urban supply from the mid-19th century until the early 20th century. Later on, under private monopoly, the search for water resources beyond the urban limits required the development of infrastructures such as dams and channels to keep pace with the intense urbanization of the postwar period. On the other hand, the fully public nature of the supplier in Madrid may help to explain the impressive magnitude of the waterworks, which belittle the urbanization of water of the Catalan city, while showing that ‘modernity’ in the form of ample supplies of good-quality water arrived in Madrid almost 100 years before Barcelona.

The theoretical points of departure are gender theory and two perspectives from human geography and sociology: the theory of network governance for regional development and the theory of homosocial networks. The regional policy of the EU today is characterized by a strongly emphasized governance model: i.e., an orientation towards networks and cluster initiatives. The 2004–2007 regional development programme in Värmland, a Swedish county, is a template for this policy. Its basic principles included partnership engagements, networking, EU-specific linguistic usage and superstar rhetoric. However, this seemingly innovative regional policy has roots in traditional industrial society (ironworks and paper mills). The network-planning model allows informal social structures to re-enter the arena of regional planning. Gender equality in regional government policy was challenged by the presence of a homosocial shadow (seamy-side) structure, such as secret networks and clubs on the outside of the official organizations. Networks were also important in the reproduction of traditional power structures, male dominance and hegemony. One conclusion we reach is that networking can be used mutually as a progressive force and as a conservative tool among actors in the innovation of policy.",Cluster politics;elites;gender equality;homosocial;homotopia;networks,"Research Article"

Against this background, this article explores international rural place-marketing efforts by Swedish municipalities towards affluent western European migrants, exemplified by campaigns in the Netherlands. The analysis is based on the concepts of rural place marketing and lifestyle migration. Research methods employed in this article are observation and a survey during migration information meetings, followed by interviews with both stakeholders and migrants. The results suggest that rural municipalities with less favourable or unfavourable geographic conditions are the most actively engaged in international place-marketing efforts. Participation in migration information meetings and the Internet are the most commonly used communication strategies. The engaged municipalities are selective in their consideration of target groups. Attracting even a few of the ‘right type’ of migrants (i.e. families and entrepreneurs from affluent countries) over the course of some years contributes considerably to maintaining a small municipality’s population and economic viability. However, although stakeholders claim that the marketing efforts have been effective and statistics point out that the number of Dutch migrants has increased, it is hard to distinguish the effect of rural place-marketing campaigns from the myriad possibilities for migrants to gather information about potential destination areas. Therefore, regional policy makers may consider shifting their focus to actively receiving potential migrants who are in the final stage of their decision process.",Demographic shrinkage;interviews;rural idyll;rural place marketing;Sweden,"Research Article"

Presenting a case study of employment shift at a meat processing factory in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, the article demonstrates how the promotion and acceptance by employers and others of a discourse that constructs Merthyr locals as bad workers reframes a history of local labour conflict as a matter of endemic worker deficit, and shifts attention away from problems of poor job quality to alleged problems of poor local labour supply, thus legitimating the turn to employing migrant workers in the first place. It is argued that investigating these kinds of local labour market histories is essential for developing appropriate and effective policy on immigration, employment and unemployment alike.",Labour immigration;local workers;meat processing;migrant workers;regional development;south Wales valleys;unemployment,"Research Article"

Scholars have long recognised and traced discursive shifts in EU territorial development policies, but theoretical accounts of the drivers and parameters of such shifts are rare. This article applies the multiple streams model of agenda-setting to the territorial cohesion debate in order to explore how useful this model is in analysing and predicting the outcome of a debate. The article is structured according to the three ‘streams’ that are relevant to agenda-setting: problems, policies and politics. The analysis relies on the responses to the 2008 Green Paper on Territorial Cohesion in order to determine how politically feasible different policy solutions are. More recent developments such as the Territorial Agenda 2020 and the European Commission’s proposals for Cohesion Policy for 2014–2020 are then used to assess the predictive power of multiple streams. It is shown that the model successfully predicts the endurance of solidarity-based cohesion goals, the emergence of territorial capital as a key policy solution, and the rejection of geographical criteria for the allocation of EU Structural Funds. At the same time, the multiple streams model fails to predict the introduction of spatial planning tools into EU cohesion policy. This shows that explaining a substantial redefinition of existing policy terms requires some reference to key actors’ broader discursive strategies. The article concludes that the multiple streams model has some predictive and explanatory power; criticisms of the model as overly descriptive are exaggerated.",Cohesion policy;multiple streams;spatial planning;territorial capital;territorial cohesion,"Research Article"

Analyses of trade and unit value data support accounts of the lateness of the Italian TCI’s movement in the direction of Outward Processing Traffic (OPT) and the subsequent rise of a pan-Euro-Mediterranean system. More recently, however, this system has declined as a result of new competitive challenges from China and other emerging economies that have eroded the position of Italian enterprises on export and domestic markets and adversely affected their Euro-Mediterranean suppliers. As district and value-chain theories show, the geography of industrial activities is a result of enterprise strategies and the environment in which they operate.

The main source used is the Padrón continuo, the local continuous registration system providing official data updated every year on 1 January. Regarding metropolitan area delimitation, we have decided to use that employed by the Atlas de las Áreas Urbanas de España and to situate the population threshold at 500,000 inhabitants. Fifteen urban areas satisfied the requirements. Therefore, this paper analyses, for the 2001–2011 decade, population growth and urban expansion in the 15 Spanish largest metropolitan areas. In the first phase, suburbanisation intensified while the areas simultaneously received significant international migration inflows. The latter compensated Spaniards’ exit flows from core cities, which increased their population again. The economic crisis, which began in 2008, and its significant impact on the real estate sector, drew an end to this urban expansion and growth period, as it seems to have slowed Spanish metropolitan area growth and restrained suburbanisation dynamics. Consequently, in recent years, residential mobility has decreased and metropolitan areas have entered a new phase characterised by a reduction of both foreign immigration inflows and Spaniards’ movements away from core cities. Therefore, with few exceptions, urban centres are currently once again gaining Spanish residents or at least have stopped losing them.",Crisis;foreign immigration;metropolitan areas;Spain;suburbanisation;urban growth,"Research Article"

This pan-European recycling economy, it is argued, will have the triple virtues of: first, stopping wastes being ‘dumped’ on poor countries; second, reusing them and thus decoupling economic prosperity from demands on global resources; and third, creating a wave of employment in recycling industries. European resource recovery is represented in academic and practitioner literatures as ‘clean and green’. Underpinned by a technical and physical materialism, it highlights the clean-up of Europe’s waste management and the high-tech character of resource recovery. Analysis shows this representation to mask the cultural and physical associations between recycling work and waste work, and thus to obscure that resource recovery is mostly ‘dirty’ work. Through an empirical analysis of three sectors of resource recovery (‘dry recyclables’, textiles and ships) in Northern member states, we show that resource recovery is a new form of dirty work, located in secondary labour markets and reliant on itinerant and migrant labour, often from accession states. We show therefore that, when wastes stay put within the EU, labour moves to process them. At the micro scale of localities and workplaces, the reluctance of local labour to work in this new sector is shown to connect with embodied knowledge of old manufacturing industries and a sense of spatial injustice. Alongside that, the positioning of migrant workers is shown to rely on stereotypical assumptions that create a hierarchy, connecting reputational qualities of labour with the stigmas of different dirty jobs – a hierarchy upon which those workers at the apex can play.",EU;labour;municipal waste;recycling;ship recycling;textile recycling,"Research Article"

Although both squares staged dissent, they nevertheless generated different (opposing, even) political imaginaries. The ‘upper square’ often divulged nationalistic or xenophobic discourses; the ‘lower square’ centred around more organized efforts to stage inclusive politics of solidarity. The paper suggests that, rather than focusing on the homogenizing terms Indignants’ movement/Indignant Squares we should instead be trying to develop a more nuanced theoretical understanding and a more finely grained empirical analysis of the discursive and spatial choreographies of these events. This, we argue, would allow us to go beyond either celebrating them as new political imaginaries, or condemning them as expressions of a post-political era. Talking of ‘Indignant Squares’ in the plural helps one explore in more grounded ways both the limitations and the possibilities that these events offer for opening up (or closing down) democratic politics.",Athens;crisis;democratic politics;dissent;Greece;Indignant Squares;occupy;post-politics;radical imaginary;Syntagma,"Research Article"

On the other hand, employment in the Mittelhessen cluster declined by about 15% and the cluster is characterised by negative functional and cognitive lock-in. This study tackles the existing lack of comparative in-depth longitudinal case studies with regard to cluster evolution. In doing so, the driving forces from recent conceptual approaches to cluster dynamics are exemplified empirically, which has rarely been done before. It is pointed out that dynamics at individual firm level (e.g. routines, spin-offs) are equally important – albeit highly interdependent – as those dynamics of relations (e.g. learning, rivalry, policy) and those operating at a systemic level (e.g. cluster heterogeneity, markets). Therefore we consider conceptual approaches to cluster evolution, which combine several driving forces to really understand changes, as necessary.",Industrial clusters;cluster evolution;cluster life cycles;evolutionary economic geography;lock-in,"Research Article"

The paper also presents a carefully balanced critique of governance practices that seeks to implement integrative strategies in a rather fragmented setting of development, policy and regulation. In so doing, the paper situates this specific case of urbanisation in the context of current paths and narratives of development, particularly with respect to the emergence of global ‘enclave spaces’ and the way these are becoming nested into broader network constellations.

Countries such as Turkey continue to enjoy robust economic growth due to ‘strong’ domestic demand, a ‘solid’ financial sector and an elevated geo-political ‘significance’. All these factors contributed to the robust performance of the Istanbul Stock Exchange in 2012. The recent crisis is in this respect ‘special’, since some emerging markets are now re-imagined as ‘safe havens’ in comparison with volatile Western economies, and consequently their financial markets are seen as attractive investment opportunities. However, how can the changing attractiveness of places such as Turkey be explained? In this paper I suggest that the appeal of Turkey and its financial markets is not simply a consequence of Turkey’s domestic dynamics. Reminiscent of recent debates about the links between territorial and relational spaces, I show that Turkey’s emergence as an attractive destination for financial capital is the consequence of the territorial as well as the relational dynamics of global capitalism and the power of financial actors to shape (as well as being shaped by) economic geographies. I explain how Turkey is currently been discursively framed as an alternative destination for portfolio investments through a reassessment of its geo-political and economic assets in the light of the recent financial crisis.",Discourse;emerging markets;financial crisis;financial geography;Turkey,"Research Article"

By drawing on theories of Bourdieu and Giddens and combining them with a notion of place drawn from human geography, an analytical framework for studying people’s motives for moving is developed. In this framework the concept “dwelling habitus” is central. By applying the analytical framework to the study of Danish middle-income families with children, their motives for out-migrating from Copenhagen are explored. Two broad categories of motives for moving are identified: the housing and the anti-urban. The housing motive is based on changes in housing needs during family formation and on the limited opportunities in the Copenhagen housing market. The anti-urban motive is based on a wish to bring up children in a non-urban milieu. The paper argues that an understanding of motives that focuses on the interrelationship of habitus and sense of place, the “dwelling habitus”, can inform studies of migration processes and make them more nuanced.",Counter-urbanisation;habitus;housing;migration;place,"Research Article"

This paper critically examines post-2008 flexibilization trends by focusing on Spanish, Italian and Greek regions. Starting from a contextualization of atypical employment and security, it then moves in a twofold direction; firstly, it presents the Flexible Contractual Arrangements and Active Labour Market Policies composite indicators, calculated for the NUTS-II regions of 12 member states for 2008 and 2011. These indicators reveal the changing ranking, especially of the Greek regions, towards higher labour market flexibility and relatively low levels of employability security; secondly, it focuses on the changing forms of atypical labour in the six regions that host the capital and the most important port city of Greece, Italy and Spain, respectively, by offering data on the expansion of flexible arrangements therein. The uneven flexibilization trends found in the study regions are seen as an outcome of the interaction between the general devaluation trends, different backgrounds and regionally specific patterns of labour market adjustment, while employment is found to be neither “rigid” nor “flexicure”.

The findings demonstrate that the main drivers of the development of local food networks are the pursuance of transparency and knowledge of origin, the existence of entrepreneurship potential, the coordination of networks by means of joint strategies, and the overcoming of conflict patterns. However, these factors can also be barriers to further development of local food networks.

The most important petrochemical plants in Romania have been the object of post-socialist economic restructuring. The reasons are due to the loss of the communist market, the cessation of government subsidies, and the growth of international competition, all in the face of aging production facilities. In the process, more than 30,000 workers were forced into intra-urban or urban–rural migration pushed by an emerging privatized housing market. The authorities acted with secrecy with regard to the process of privatization as well as to the ecological hazards posed by these industrial ruins.

In a nutshell, the Smart City refers to projects and planning strategies that aim to join up new forms of inclusive and low-carbon economic growth based on the knowledge economy through the deployment of information and communication technologies. However, at the same time as new urban Smart interventions are being designed and applied, insufficient attention has been paid to how these strategies are inserted into the wider political economy and, in particular, the political ecology of urban transformation. Therefore, in this paper we critically explore the implementation of the Smart City, tracing how the ‘environment’ and environmental concerns have become an organising principle in Barcelona’s Smart City strategy. Through an urban political ecology prism we aim to critically reflect upon the contradictions of the actually existing Smart City in Barcelona and how Smart discourses and practices might be intentionally or unintentionally mobilised in ways that serve to depoliticise urban redevelopment and environmental management. The paper stresses the need to repoliticise the debates on the Smart City and put citizens back at the centre of the urban debate.",District heating;infrastructure;self-sufficient city;smart city;Spain;sustainability,"Research Article"

The identification and development of new cross-sectoral growth trajectories has been described elsewhere as building ‘regional development platforms’. This article contributes to conceptual debates about cross-sectoral regional development platforms and provides an empirical analysis of attempts to create and develop such a platform. From a conceptual perspective we argue that the notion of related variety can help policymakers to identify potential combinatorial platform opportunities, but may overestimate the ability of ‘related’ actors to collaborate together in innovative ways, because knowledge is embedded in practice and the process of ‘combining’ knowledge in new activities is therefore challenging. The paper illuminates the development of cross-sectoral platforms by examining the creation of new activities from a practice perspective that directs attention to the everyday activities, routines and understandings that constitute the ‘doing’ of economic development. We explore the development of a cross sectoral platform in the North Jutland region of Denmark, which integrates actors from the food and tourism sectors into a new food-tourism platform. We identify the dominant forms of the practices of producing food, retailing, catering, and promoting tourism, and then consider the ways in which these have changed in response to new cross-sectoral initiatives. The analysis shows that some aspects of practice are easier to change than others, and we conclude that an analytical approach inspired by practice theory can identify the requirements in terms of micro-level change in the practices of actors that is required for an initiative to succeed.",Food;practice;regional development platforms;related variety;tourism,"Research Article"

It detects a limiting effect on the development of effective policy-making and scrutiny functions, and a prolonged period of time taken to develop effective civil society mechanisms at a territorial level.

Whereas much of the existing research focused on the extent to which welfare states affect the well-being of immigrants after their admission, this study focuses on how immigration policy regimes affect the extent to which immigrant flows, and subsequent labour supply, match variations and fluctuations in the composition of demand in urban labour markets. In particular, the article develops a comparison between Malmö and Genoa, an Italian and a Swedish city with similar urban histories that display considerably different patterns of urban inequality. Immigration to Malmö was fuelled largely by humanitarian emergencies in the countries of origin and occurred in a period of economic decline for the city. The growth of the immigrant population was associated with a worsening of the labour market situation for immigrants and an increase in ethnic residential segregation. Immigration to Genoa was mainly driven by demand for cheap labour, particularly in the private-care sector. Therefore, the growth of the immigrant population was associated with an ethnic segmentation of the labour market, but it also resulted in a more dispersed distribution of immigrants than in Malmö. The differences in the urban inequality patterns in Malmö and Genoa can be only partly explained by policies affecting the living conditions of admitted immigrants. An important role has also been played by the immigration policy regimes of the two countries, which prescribed the integration potential of immigrant flows.",Immigration policy regime;residential segregation;urban inequality;welfare state,"Research Article"

This is one expression of neo-liberalisation as the dominant political force in the EU, combined with deep austerity policies in response to the crises of 2007/2008. Within the Eurozone, a common currency without a common fiscal policy further intensified inequalities, especially between the economies of the north and south of the EU. These developments had profound political ramifications as the promise of increasing economic growth and material well-being has been rudely shattered for many people and unemployment, poverty and ill-being have burgeoned in many parts of the EU. The political response to this – in ways reminiscent of the 1930s – has been a resurgence of regressive virulent right-wing nationalisms, sometimes with fascistic tendencies, as people have come to see the EU, and neoliberal globalisation, as inimical to their interests. This tendency has been further intensified by inflows of migrants and refugees, many in response to neo-imperialist ventures in the Middle East.

After 1989/1990, the point in time of fundamental societal change in eastern Europe, this concern was transferred to estates in post-socialist cities. However, empirical evidence for a general negative trend has not emerged. Recent publications confirm the persistence of social mix and highlight the differentiated trajectories of estates. This paper aims to contribute to an approach of how to conceptually make sense of these differentiated trajectories. Using data from a unique longitudinal survey in East Germany, starting in 1979, we investigate the state of social mix, drivers of social change and the inner differentiation in the housing estate Leipzig-Grünau. We found no proof for a dramatic social decline, rather there is evidence for a slow and multi-faceted change in the social and demographic structure of the residents contributing to a gradual social fragmentation of the estate. This is a result of path dependencies, strategic planning effects and ownership structures. We discuss these drivers of large housing estate trajectories and their related impacts by adapting a framework of multiple, overlapping institutional, social and urban post-socialist transformations. We suggest embedding the framework in a wider and a local context in which transformations need to be seen. In conclusion, we argue for a theoretical debate that makes sense of contextual differences within such transformations.",Context;large housing estates;Leipzig-Grünau;multiple transformations;neighbourhood change;post-socialist transition;social mix,"Research Article"

Rather than playing a strong leadership role, the planning department on the internal front and the entire municipality on the external front have chosen a role based on co-creation with citizens and other relevant stakeholders. The benefits of this approach may include the bottom-up character of several projects, better responsiveness and greater opportunities for different categories of actors; the drawbacks may include greater difficulty in ensuring that certain objective are reached (e.g. in terms of fairness and representativeness) and a higher risk of the dispersion of resources. This case also points to the difficulty of assessing the social sustainability of multiple rather than individual projects and programmes combined in a Smart City strategy: projects may reinforce each other in their social impact, or otherwise hinder possible benefits; also, a municipality may choose a combination of smart projects and programmes that attach different weights to economic, environmental and social sustainability objectives.",Citizen participation;Smart City;social sustainability;strategy co-creation;urban governance,"Research Article"

While the reaction of the San Lorenzo neighbourhood to the eviction of Communia (August 2013) was highly supportive of the squatters, the residents’ committee in Nuova Ponte di Nona promoted a strong public campaign for the eviction of squatters in a building in Cerruti Street (December 2013). This raised the question of how such different responses, taking place within the same metropolitan area in the same year, can be framed. Based on interviews and the collection of secondary data, the paper addresses this question by showing how the residents of these two neighbourhoods embody the two poles of the process of subjectification created by the singular asset-based Italian welfare regime, the ‘financialization of home’ and the increasingly precarious nature of living conditions. However, a dualistic and rigid account of the neighbourhood reactions is avoided by considering the ‘commoning’ dimension as central to the actions and campaigns of both. Indeed, it shows how the residents’ committees in both cases were engaged in (re)creating new urban commons challenging the increasing privatization and individualization of everyday life prompted by neoliberal/austerity-based urbanism. The case of Nuova Ponte di Nona, however, shows that urban commons are not intrinsically emancipatory, and that the material conditions shaping the community life can lead to viewing the ‘other’ (i.e. the squatters) as a threat to their lifestyle aspirations.",Commoning;financialization of home;precariousness;Rome;squats eviction;subjectification,"Research Article"

We use evidence aggregated from plant-level data on installed electricity generation capacity in the EUropean electric utilities sector over the period 1990–2013 to demonstrate how the unintended interaction between EU policies on energy market liberalization and climate change have led to new renewable energy entrants and more widely dispersed ownership of total generation capacity. Our empirical results suggest that six energy geography concepts enable deeper insights into the spatiality of the EUropean energy transition. Specifically, we find that territoriality and scaling are key lenses for interpreting the differentiated change processes occurring at EUropean, subregional and national levels. The EUropean energy transition is unlikely to converge onto a single trajectory any time soon, but particularly subregional approaches are argued to offer policy-makers with more spatially cognizant and effective levers.",Energy geographies;energy transition;European Union;generation capacity;internal energy market;renewable;spatiality;subregional patterns,"Research Article"

Countless initiatives for creative clusters, cultural quarters and culture-led urban policies have mushroomed since the mid-1990s. Being exceptionally rich and dense in cultural amenities and institutions, creative production and cultural consumption, Italy seemed to be the natural ground for such a cultural turn in policymaking. In fact, Italy has been the cradle for cultural districts (CDs) since the early 2000s, fostering both analytical and normative speculations and experiments. Despite this richness, a systematic study of CD policy implementation is lacking and several questions are still pending, in Italy as well as in other countries. For example, how diverse are the CD experiences being developed; and what are the aims and core activities, the urban and regional settings and development effects? This paper presents an original survey of 68 experimentations that were officially labelled as ‘cultural districts’ over the last 15 years in Italy: as such it constitutes the first attempt at a nation-wide comprehensive analysis of CD policy. Even though the major importance of CDs as an analytical tool is acknowledged, the evidence gathered in this study shows the fuzziness and inconsistencies in the implementation of CD policy in Italy. The analysis shows the uneven regional geography of CDs, stresses the large variety of contents and promoters and high rate of failure, and the limited degree of specialization and integration with cultural industries. The paper reconsiders critically the policy notion and practice of CDs in Italy and calls for further international scholarly and policy debates.",Cluster;cultural districts;cultural policy;fuzzy concept;Italy,"Research Article"

Because they facilitate movement across nation-state borders, these networks are central to European integration and have in fact constituted a key EU policy issue for more than two decades. Some authors have argued that their development has been driven by a hegemonic discourse that promotes the production of a ‘Europe of Flows’: a single, uniform space underpinned by a vision of ‘frictionless’ mobility through inter-city networks. However, the existence of such a discourse is questionable given the variety of rationales that may potentially influence the development of this type of infrastructure. Their claim is evaluated by means of an in-depth empirical study of the policy process surrounding a high-speed rail line of EU relevance in the Spanish region of the Basque Country. The analysis of the discursive constructions mobilized in this process indicates that the discourse on a ‘Europe of Flows’ is better conceptualized as one of the several storylines associated with different scales through which a wider hegemonic discourse is articulated. Whilst the heterogeneity of this discourse did not fundamentally contradict the development of a trans-European high-speed rail line, it did result in a policy compromise according to the influence the different coalitions were able to exert in the policy process. The analysis largely demonstrates the importance of considering the multi-scalar discursive landscape of policy-making in order to understand trans-European infrastructure development.",Discourse analysis;European integration;high-speed rail;space of flows;trans-European infrastructure,"Research Article"

Using a qualitative case study approach, this paper significantly adds to regional studies of migration to investigate comparisons of migrant and local workers in regions of low unemployment, where managerial views towards locals are not as negative. The paper finds that, owing to low levels of labour market power as a result of basic English language skills and problems of transferability of qualifications, migrants are finding new ways of signalling their higher productivity. These are low levels of absence and a willingness to work longer hours, frequently termed a ‘good work ethic’ by managers, and used to positively distinguish migrant workers even in regions of low unemployment. The paper then investigates what happens to the demonstration of this ‘work ethic’ over time, finding that these behaviours are less likely to be used as labour market power increases.",Employment relations;food manufacturing;migration;skills;temporary work;unemployment,"Research Article"

Most European countries saw an increasingly ageing population and an internal migration from underdeveloped to more competitive locations. Since the turn of the century, and in contrast to the past, a great deal has been written about the causes and impacts of shrinkage, as well as about policies and planning strategies. However, the state of knowledge in a cross-national comparative perspective is rather poor because, to date, studies have basically analysed large cities and empirical evidence hardly shifts attention to the contextual influence on local dynamics. Against this background, this paper fills the gap between macrotheoretical conceptualisation and empirical observation by testing a heuristic model of urban shrinkage encompassing the whole range of cities in Europe. The paper questions to what extent urban shrinkage represents a broader trend in Europe in terms of both duration and distribution, and aims to investigate the influence of economic and demographic drivers on the non-linear evolution of shrinking cities in Europe. Thereby, the spatial distribution of different trajectories of shrinking cities in urban Europe in the period from 1990 to 2010 will be presented in a comprehensive survey which reveals that 20% of European cities experienced shrinkage between 1990 and 2010, whereas 883 cities face recent shrinkage.",Cross-national comparative perspective;demographic typology;local scale;shrinking cities;trajectory,"Research Article"

In particular, we focus on two self-organized spaces, namely, a social centre and a squatted public garden and discuss two concrete instances of drasis. We propose that drasis instigates the establishment and evolution of transformative, prefigurative organizing through three interrelated processes, namely, the formation of resistance assemblages, social learning and socio-spatial solidarity.

Yet, more recent trends towards digitalisation and conceptual advances towards a time-spatial perspective on innovation processes require a more fundamental re-thinking of the nexus of development, innovation policies and territoriality. This paper therefore aims to advance an agenda for reconceptualising region-based innovation policies beyond the assumptions of territoriality implicit in territorial innovations models and related policy schemes. “Open Region” is a heuristic way of thinking about proactive policy measures for redesigning the dialectic interplay between territorial openness and closure. These measures, in essence, aim at creating and exploiting opportunities for innovation within a region by mobilising external expertise and establishing local anchors for innovation. Finally, we address the limitations of applicability and discuss incentives for regional actors to embark on Open Region strategies. The suggested measures can work together, yet it is also possible to utilise them in an eclectic manner or to selectively recombine them in order to address different local conditions.",Innovation policies;open innovation;innovation processes;regional development;territories,"Research Article"

However, empirical analyses of TN are lacking, despite European integration and the wider context SNAs find themselves within evolving. Consequently, little remains understood about how SNAs engage in TN and how they are affected by Europeanization pressures. Using the case of TN undertaken by SNAs in South East England and Northern France, this article finds that Europeanization has created more opportunities for SNAs to engage at the European level. SNAs have, in turn, taken advantage of these opportunities, leading to increased participation in TN. However, SNAs’ approaches to TN are not uniform. Engagement remains marked by differentiation as local-level factors, such as local strategy and political objectives, affect how SNAs participate in TN. This differentiation is likely to become increasingly marked as SNAs respond to contemporary challenges, such as budgetary pressures and, in the case of South East England, Brexit.",Cross-border co-operation;English Channel;Europeanization;subnational government;transnational networking,"Research Article"

In countries deeply affected by the economic recession, the crisis has produced a significant incentive to change transport and mobility habits towards cheaper and affordable modes of transport. The impacts of the crisis have been spatially heterogeneous and socially diverse, and consequently mobility adaptation strategies depend on both territorial and social resilience. The present paper analyzes the main changes of mobility habits that occurred between 2004–2012 in the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, covering the end of the era of economic growth, and the advent and unfolding of the economic crisis. The research uses travel survey data to understand how different population groups have adapted their mobility to the crisis, and how core and outer metropolitan areas have shaped the adaptation strategies of their inhabitants. The results show a general trend towards a rationalized use of private modes in favor of an increased use of shorter trips and non-motorized modes, but also show how social factors and urban forms interact to generate significant differences in mobility adaptation strategies.",Adaptation strategies;economic crisis;mobility;mobility habits;territorial resilience,"Research Article"

This paper focuses on the enforced lack of illumination in the home, and the strategies and tactics undertaken by households to overcome this challenge.

I have established that the under-consumption of light is one of the most pronounced expressions of energy poverty, and as such endangers the ability to participate in the customs that define membership of society. But the emergence of activist-led amateur electricians and the symbolic and material mobilization of light for political purposes have also created multiple opportunities for resistance.",Austerity;economic crisis;energy poverty;energy services;fuel poverty;Greece;illumination,"Research Article"

Firstly, this paper provides evidence of the relationships between three dynamics of state restructuring and the disposal of public land and real estate properties owned by one sector of the French state, that is, the railways. Secondly, the paper focuses on two UDPs of railway sites, respectively located in Paris and Nantes, in order to disclose the specificity of the redevelopment process associated with public railway properties, due to the socio-legal infrastructure of railway land disposal stemming from these dynamics. The paper demonstrates that (i) state restructuring impels various levels and organisations of the state to redevelop public land and real estate properties; and (ii) the effects of state restructuring can be explained only by analysing the mediating role of the socio-legal infrastructure of these properties, which frames the processes and outcomes of the redevelopment projects.

The European Union considered several of the ENI CBC programmes that Finland and Russia participate in for the sanctions list. These programmes are implemented by a multiplicity of actors that include supra-national, national and regional authorities and form a dense actor-network with vertical and horizontal relations. The political relations between the actors are influenced by geopolitical discourses, bordering effects and power imbalances that are conceptualised in this paper as practices of territoriality. Previous research has insufficiently addressed the territoriality of actor relations within the multi-level governance (MLG) structures of CBC. Territoriality is present in MLG in the sense that CBC actors from various political levels significantly contribute to the territorial logic of political power by promoting their own interests towards cooperation practices. The research problem in this paper stems from the alleged non-hierarchical organisation of actors in CBC and argues that MLG policy structures do not render equality among the different actors and that they fail to consider the impact of territoriality. The paper investigates how territoriality influences the actor relations in the MLG structure of ENI CBC and how the actors cope with the frictions that emerge out of territoriality. Qualitative interviews reveal a conflicting system of governance in Finnish–Russian ENI CBC that fluctuates between state centrality and region-based initiatives to address frictions of various territorialit(ies) produced by actors.",Cross-border cooperation;European Union;Finnish–Russian border;multi-level governance;territoriality,"Research Article"

Thus, emphasis has been placed for instance on lowering customs tariffs and encouraging the free movement of goods and people. However, if the opening up of borders creates new opportunities for some residents of border regions, there are others who may not benefit. For this reason, and in a context characterized by the rise of Euroscepticism, it seems crucial to take a more critical look at actual cross-border integration and to unravel its concrete consequences for the people who live in border regions. This paper aims to do so by focusing on two aspects of this process: the functional dimension, through the number of cross-border activities, and the perceptions border residents have of their neighbours, through the level of mutual social trust. The EUROBAROMETER 422 survey is used in order to produce statistical analyses and maps. This enables us to offer a new image of European cross-border integration and to draw the following conclusions. Firstly, cross-border flows are not uniform and vary greatly from one cross-border area to another. Secondly, cross-border regions in which the intensity of flows between neighbouring regions is high do not necessarily show a high level of mutual social trust between borderland populations. Thirdly, there is not always reciprocity with regard to the mutual social trust that people have towards their neighbours within cross-border areas.",Border regions;cross-border integration;Eurobarometer;European integration;Euroscepticism,"Research Article"

Drawing on a theoretical framework that combines the concepts of travelling ideas, mobile urbanism and neoliberalisation, this paper explores how an actor-network is being constructed to mobilise support for a BID pilot scheme in Denmark. The introduction of BID-inspired concepts in Denmark represents an illustrative case of how mobile urban policies are translated into local contexts as part of continuous processes of neoliberalisation of urban governance and policy-making. In Denmark, the BID model is promoted as a market-based planning tool to support progressive planning goals of supporting town centres as vibrant commercial centres. Furthermore, the BID concept is, among Danish planners, perceived as a useful organisational framework for the construction of public–private partnerships as add-ons to area-based renewal initiatives in order to strengthen local community support. Such interpretations are not only in stark contrast to BIDs implemented elsewhere, but also require a significant reconfiguration of the model to fit local needs. However, despite the strong social focus, the potential negative consequences of implementing BIDs, such as privatisation and commodification of public space, are barely discussed in the current initial stage of translating the BID model into a Danish context. This raises serious concerns about to what extent planners in Denmark unreflectively are copying a policy concept from elsewhere, with little regard to how the concept should be adapted and what it has to offer in a Danish context.",Business improvement districts;neoliberalisation;retail planning;spatial planning;urban policy mobility,"Research Article"

These events disrupted park access during race weekends, but also in the periods when the venue was assembled/disassembled. The events were resisted by a community action group whose campaigning eventually resulted in the decision by Formula E to cease racing in Battersea Park. The paper analyses how Formula E events were justified and opposed using a form of rhetorical analysis inspired by the work of Michael Billig. Interviews were undertaken with key stakeholders involved in the case and their arguments were analysed to reveal different ways of thinking about public parks. The dispute is understood as one underpinned by different interpretations of who and what a park is for, and by contrasting views on the impact of interruptions to everyday routines. The Formula E events reduced public access, but the dispute surrounding the events arguably made Battersea Park more public by generating debate and by provoking local activists to defend their park.",Commercialisation;discourse;disruption;events;Formula E;motorsport;parks;public space;resistance;rhetoric,"Research Article"

However, innovation, when defined in a broad sense, incorporates a variety of processes and outputs that cut across organisational, sectoral, territorial and knowledge boundaries. This paper seeks to make a contribution to this literature by focusing on the experiences of less developed regions, and by examining how different knowledge bases contribute to technological upgrading and higher added value for firms. It argues that in regions where access to advanced knowledge and technology is restricted, or where firms do not have the absorptive capacity to access, absorb and exploit such knowledge, combining existing knowledge in innovative ways may be the best strategy for firms to become more innovative and competitive. It also argues that this combination can happen through vertical integration within the firm, or by the creation and maintenance of inter-firm mechanisms that stimulate knowledge dissemination. These themes are discussed by drawing on the evolution of the wine industry in three Portuguese regions. These regions have all experienced different trajectories, in terms of the renewal of their wine industry, and it is argued that this is in part the result of endogenous regional characteristics.",Combinatorial knowledge bases;knowledge coordination;vertical integration;less developed regions;local value chains,"Research Article"

As a broad but contested toolkit of technological services and policy interventions aimed at improving the efficacy and efficiency of urban systems, the “smart city” is subject to several pressing critiques. This paper acknowledges these concerns, but recognizes the potential of “urban intelligence” to enhance the resiliency of metropolitan areas. As such, we focus on an under-researched dimension of smart city urbanism: its application in peripheral urban areas. The paper introduces a threefold typology of: (a) geographic (spatial); (b) hard (material); and (c) soft (social) urban peripherality. Second, it reviews the concept of urban resilience and considers how its central characteristics can inform the objectives and implementation of “smart city” infrastructures and planning. Six European smart city plans are assessed via a qualitative content analysis, to identify the target of smart city actions; the characteristics of urban resilience mobilized; and the spatial focus of planned interventions. The comparative analysis reveals a variegated set of smart-city approaches. Notably, “smart” actions aimed at enhancing social innovation are the most common type of intervention, while overall there remains a strong tendency for smart urbanism to focus on the urban core. We conclude by calling for a research agenda addressing smartness in, of, and for, peripheral urban spaces and communities.",Comparative urbanism;peripheral urbanization;smart urbanism;urban infrastructure;urban and spatial planning,"Research Article"

Yet as research has progressed, it has become clear that experimentation is not a singular phenomenon that can be readily understood using any one conceptual entry point. In this paper, we focus on one particular mode of experimentation – the urban living laboratory (ULL) – and develop a typology through which to undertake a comparative analysis of 40 European ULLs, to understand how and why such forms of experimentation are being designed and implemented, and to identify the particular forms of experimentation they entail. We argue that there are distinct types of ULL taking shape, delimited by the ways in which they are designed and deployed through, on the one hand, specific kinds of configuration and practice and, on the other hand, by the ways in which they take laboratory form: the different dispositions towards the laboratory they entail. We propose three ‘ideal’ ULL types – strategic, civic and organic – and argue that these can be placed along the spectrum of four dispositions: trial, enclave, demonstration and platform.",Disposition;experimentation;governance;sustainability;urban living laboratory,"Research Article"

In fact, the ‘smart city’ has become a widely spread vision used by a variety of powerful key actors as well as a top-down urban political strategy that is applied in order to promote new arrangements, models and technologies for almost all policy areas. By using the Italian case as a point of reference, this paper analyses how smart city strategies are institutionalized and embedded in times of crisis on different spatial scales. Therefore, the paper adapts a strategic-relational approach that provides a conceptual framework for understanding the spatial dimension of smart city strategies. It argues that smart city strategies reflect a set of multiscalar political strategies leading to new responsibilities and powers on a local scale, as well as the creation of new state territoriality. Smart cities in Italy are part of metropolitan reforms that strengthen the role of large cities while reproducing existing territorial inequalities. Furthermore, they are used to create new public–private partnerships and new investment opportunities on different spatial scales. In addition, a content analysis of smart city rankings and reports sheds light on the modes of representation of smart city strategies, analysing them as elements of policymaking in times of crisis.",Crisis;Italy;multiscalarity;smart city;urban political strategies,"Research Article"

Firstly, capital cities are promoted as ‘national champions’ in the context of global territorial competition. Secondly, metropolitan regions are characterised by recurrent crises of ‘governability’ as economic, social, environmental and infrastructural interdependencies escape existing jurisdictional scales. However, this process is highly uneven, reflecting the ways in which cities are embedded in their national contexts. Drawing from the literature on varieties of capitalism, and in particular O’Riain’s perspective on the Irish case, we suggest that in an era when cities are claimed to be acting as ‘national champions’, territorial politics need to be more strongly foregrounded in these discussions. Through an in-depth qualitative case-study of Dublin (Ireland), we argue that while government power may be strongly centralised in the city of Dublin, the spatial entity of Dublin is relatively powerless. Despite a number of recommendations since the 1970s, there has been little will or action to meaningfully devolve power to the city-regional level in any way, contrary to comparative European experiences. The paper illustrates how a central state stranglehold over the Dublin metropolitan area is hampering the efficient governance and sustainable development of the city. These governance constraints at the sub-national level with significant planning implications indicate a reluctance to engage with the metropolitan as a particular territorial scale in Ireland – and a profound fixity in the architecture of the state.

In this paper, we study the transformation of urban governance in the Low Countries through city case studies of Apeldoorn (Netherlands) and Antwerp (Belgium). We show how Dutch urban governance is financialized by connecting local public finance with financialized real estate markets through municipal land banks. However, inter-municipal financial solidarity and ring-fencing municipalities from financial markets create specific continental European processes of financialization. Flemish municipalities, in contrast, have shifted from a model of laissez-faire urban development (embedded in a system of large municipal autonomy) towards entrepreneurial urban growth regimes, in which technocratic public and private actors have increased access to public financial resources, which are used to create large urban renewal projects. In Belgium, autonomous municipal real estate corporations are a crucial instrument for connecting municipal finance to the real estate market.",Entrepreneurialism;financialization;Flanders;the Netherlands;urban governance,"Research Article"

Taking Little Mountain in Vancouver as the first example, we examine the privatization and demolition of the public housing complex and thus the withdrawal of the state. Our second example, Ostend in Frankfurt, investigates the restructuring of a working-class neighbourhood through active state-led interventions including massive public investment. We analyse the two empirical examples along five dimensions: causal drivers and mechanisms that have led to the changing role of the state in governing urban transformations; policy instruments used by state agencies to encourage gentrification; strategies to legitimize state-led gentrification; outcomes in terms of direct and exclusionary displacement; and the forms of contestation and protest.

Initial attempts to develop the area began in the early 1980s but came to nothing; a previous study of the same area attributed that failure to the inability of fragmented local political elites to coalesce into an effective pro-growth coalition. In the early 2000s, a new coalition of political and economic actors, in particular financial and real estate interests, revived the process of regeneration and drove construction of a large-scale mixed-use project. This article offers an account of the process in terms of both the internal dynamics of the local coalition and the contextual and institutional factors framing the bargaining of political and economic elites over the development process. We use two theoretical frameworks – growth machine theory and regime theory – to assess the distribution of power and resources. Our analysis indicates that the outcome is the result of a specific growth machine fuelled by international capital, and that changes in the intergovernmental system in Italy induced local political elites to accommodate the requirements of international investors.",Growth machine;Milan;urban development project;urban regime,"Research Article"

Both queries are discussed by pinpointing the multi-scalar investment strategies of the private equity firm, Blackstone, which emerged as the predominant institutional investor during the recovery phase of the Spanish property market. The article initially sketches out the trajectory of the political economy of housing in Spain, and then it focuses on the strategies pursued by Blackstone for the acquisition of real estate and housing stock. The following sections connect the nodes of the financial chain that link this investor to former social housing tenants whose homes are by now owned by Blackstone.

It demonstrates that mass housing projects that increase the importance of market-based processes and financial assets at the expense of intangible assets (household relations and social capital) make the urban poor more vulnerable to displacement pressure and external shocks. Using the example of a mass housing project in Turkey designed for the relocation of a highly concentrated Kurdish migrant squatter settlement, this research demonstrates that slum development projects can cause different types of displacement, divesting residents of opportunities to accumulate assets and reconstruct a sense of place. The research demonstrates that the dissolution of intangible assets and the exclusion of social spaces that are important to relocated residents in the mass housing estate bring about community displacement in the case of Kurdish residents. Also, relocated squatters feel pressured by the ongoing and daily experiences of displacement—notably everyday, symbolic and temporal displacement—as the spatial design of the mass housing unfamiliar with the livelihood of squatter dwellers constrains their opportunities to appropriate neighbourhood space in everyday life and enact a sense of place.",Displacement;housing;poverty;slums;urban transformation,"Research Article"

By means of focusing on the airport industry (i.e. an integral component of the wider air transport system), the paper aims to help bridge the gap between economic geography, where air transport has received little attention, and transport geography, which so far has made little use of the theoretical advancements made in economic geography. The paper discusses the example of Poland where, further to the fall of communism, regional development became a key ambition for local and regional governments and where the importance of passenger aviation is rapidly increasing. Drawing from 16 interviews with airlines, Polish airports and Polish local authorities, and from documentary analysis, the paper explores the ways in which local/regional governments charge their airports with the path-shaping tasks of fostering strategic couplings with airlines and catalysing new forms of growth. This includes financial and political support, joint marketing and imposing challenging targets. The paper also shows that the transformation of Polish airports from passive assets into active agents of regional development (a process that is referred to as the ‘agentisation of airports’) is inherently path-dependent.

Most literature on agri-food policy and law in the European Union has conceptualized policy making and implementation as an institutional process involving multiple levels of governance. In this perspective, Europeanization is understood as a process through which stakeholders formulate, negotiate, and implement legal principles and procedures across various institutions at different levels of governance. By employing the conceptual tools developed in geographical research, we contribute a spatial and historical dimension to these studies. Our analysis shows how the politics of scale and sociospatial positionality can help explain idiosyncratic shifts in food policies in new European Union member states that could not be attributed solely to institutional processes. To develop these arguments, our empirical analysis focuses on shifting agri-food regulatory frameworks for Alternative Food Networks in Lithuania. In particular, we analyze how and why Lithuanian authorities began changing and simplifying food safety and veterinary requirements for the production, processing, and distribution of small quantities of food products sold directly to consumers through Alternative Food Networks in the local market. We show how Lithuania’s positionality in regional and global markets contributed to the growth of the direct sales sector. Our analysis also reveals the agency of local producers and consumers in creating conditions for policy change. This analysis suggests that Europeanization of food politics in the new European Union member states is best understood as a spatial reordering of the region and its historical relationships.",Alternative food networks;eastern enlargement;Europeanization;food standards;Lithuania,"Research Article"

However, empirical research that explores the real-world functioning of these arrangements is comparatively limited. This paper will help address this gap through the case of Newcastle City Futures (NCF) – a university-anchored platform for collaborative urban foresight research, public engagement and innovation. In particular, the paper will concentrate on a two-year period when NCF focused on the facilitation of innovation demonstrator projects guided by the vision of Newcastle upon Tyne developing a postindustrial future as a ‘test-bed city’. Detailed empirical accounts of the development of two demonstrator projects are used to illustrate and analyse processes of cross-sectoral collaboration and engaging the public in co-design. These are used to support the conceptual argument that the presence of the quadruple helix as a form of local innovation system should not be taken as given. Instead, the collaborative relationships required for transformational interventions in the future of cities need to be actively constructed by diverse actors and supported by intermediary vehicles such as NCF.",Innovation test-bed;living laboratories;quadruple helix;smart city;Urban Living Partnership,"Research Article"

This research is motivated by the fact that, in contrast to leading financial and banking centres that attract considerable research attention, small banking centres have remained under-researched, despite their large number and the important role they play in their host communities and regions. This paper deals with the recent evolutionary dynamics of 199 small European banking centres and is based on an analysis of the economic performance of individual banks aggregated at the city level where they have their headquarters. The analysed indicators cover size, profitability and the level of risk of particular banks over the 2004–2015 period. In addition, the data were analysed for three basic European macro-regions (western Europe, southern Europe and central and eastern Europe) and in terms of the ownership of the banks headquartered in particular centres (foreign versus domestic). Our investigation shows that, even though a significant decline has been observed in the number of these centres, the financial performance of banks headquartered in small financial centres differs widely, depending significantly upon the European macro-region (a decisive number of defunct banking centres was concentrated in southern Europe) and the ownership structure.",European banking centres;foreign capital;European macro-regions;financial geography;global financial crisis,"Research Article"

Amidst the growing literature, there are, however, few comprehensive analyses of processes of migrants’ social integration. Drawing on the lived experience of Polish migrants in a rural area in Norway and applying the theoretical framework of social exposures, the article illustrates the important role of the migrants’ position on the local labour market, the socio-demographics of the receiving locality and the material and geographical properties of the area for the dynamics of their social integration. Findings show how migrants’ desires to engage in migrant/non-migrant relationships are challenged by the increasingly ethnically divided local labour market, amidst growing migration to the location and by the geographical structure of the locality. The changing and intersecting character of those domains fosters conditions that promote primarily social exposure of the migrants to their own co-ethnics, isolating them from the local community. At the same time, the study illustrates that mutual engagement of the migrants and the local inhabitants, as well as having children, play a significant role in diversifying migrants’ local social contacts.",Exposures–isolations;social integration;rural areas;Polish migrants;Norway,"Research Article"
"Regional concentration of university graduates: The role of high school grades and parental background",Merje Kuus;;;;;;;Paul Vallance;;;;;;;Mark Tewdwr-Jones;;;;;Louise Kempton;;;;;Bilge Serin;;;;;;;Harry Smith;;;;;Chris McWilliams;;;;;Jiří Blažek;;;;;;;Tereza Hejnová;;;;;;;Jakub Stachowski;;;;;;;Kent Eliasson;;;;;Mika Haapanen;;;;;;;Olle Westerlund;;;;;,2020,56,0,"In this paper, we analyse long-term changes in the regional distribution and migration flows of university graduates in Finland and Sweden. This study is based on detailed longitudinal population register data, including information on high school grades and parental background. We find a distinct pattern of skill divergence across regions in both countries over the last 3 decades. The uneven distribution of human capital has been reinforced by the mobility patterns of university graduates, for whom regional sorting by high school grades and parental background is evident. Our findings indicate that traditional measures of human capital concentration most likely underscore actual regional differences in productive skills.",Human capital;local labour market areas (LMAs);migration;parental background;school grades;university graduates,"Research Article"
